"""
Exercise flexdoc's normalized-form views over a single document: the section tree,
per-section structural block slices, link rollups per section, and density-invariant
block/item tallies.

Everything printed here is a *calculated view* over one parse — flexdoc stores no
counts. The structural block tree is density-invariant, so tight and loose spacing of
the same list produce identical tallies.

Run from the repository checkout with: `uv run python examples/normalized_form.py`

    # Project Overview

    A short intro with a [homepage](https://example.com) link.

    ## Features

    - fast parsing
    - exact source spans
      - paragraphs
      - sentences
    - link extraction

    ## Roadmap

    Planned milestones, in order:

    1. ship block spans
    2. ship the normalized form

    See the [tracking issue](https://example.com/issues/1) for details.

    | Milestone | Status |
    | --------- | ------ |
    | spans     | done   |
    | rollups   | wip    |

    ```python
    # density does not change the tally
    doc = FlexDoc.from_text(text)
