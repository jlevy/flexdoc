"""
The `collect()` query primitive over a `NodeTable`.

`collect()` is the single general query primitive for the document model (DR-4).
It gathers matching nodes from the node table, optionally scoped to a subtree,
filtered by kind, predicate, or offset containment. Results may overlap their
containers (query semantics, not partition semantics).

Counts, values, and groupings are left to the caller via plain Python
(e.g. `Counter(n.kind for n in collect(...))`).

    Gather nodes from `table` matching the given filters, in document order.

    Two distinct relations select candidates. The tree relation `subtree_of` is a
    node id restricting results to that node's within-layer parent/child subtree
    (`recursive` descends the whole subtree, else only direct children). The
    interval relations are cross-layer and offset-based, each accepting a node id
    or an explicit `(start, end)` span: `within` keeps nodes whose span is
    contained in the region (region's span for a node id); `overlaps` keeps nodes
    whose span intersects the region. With no relation, candidates are the root
    nodes (or all nodes when `recursive`); supplying an interval relation scans all
    nodes, so `within=section_id` needs no `recursive=True`.

    `kinds`: restrict to these `NodeKind`s (None = any).
    `where`: additional `Node -> bool` predicate. `inline`: include inline-kind
    nodes; an explicit `kinds` naming inline kinds (e.g. `{NodeKind.link}`) implies
    this, so the common case works without `inline=True`. `layer`: restrict to
    these parse layers (None = all); since the same span can appear in several
    layers (e.g. a `markdown` block and a `textual` paragraph), scope by `layer` to
    avoid cross-layer duplicates.
