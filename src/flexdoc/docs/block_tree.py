"""
Structural block tree for a Markdown document, with exact source spans.

This is the opt-in, whole-document structural view (`FlexDoc.blocks()`) that resolves
what blank-line paragraph splitting cannot: it keeps a fenced code block whole even when
it contains blank lines, and it decomposes a list into individual `list_item`s with
nested sublists regardless of item spacing.

Block boundaries and spans come straight from flowmark's parser: every block element
produced by `flowmark_markdown().parse(text)` carries an authoritative
`element.span = (start, end)` read from marko's own parser state (see
`flowmark.markdown_ast.block_span`). flexdoc makes no block-boundary decisions of its
own, so there is no regex scanner and no per-line heuristic.

Containers (lists, list items, blockquotes) fully populate their block children
recursively, so a table inside a blockquote or a paragraph inside a list item is
reachable in the tree. The top-level `blocks()`/`parse_blocks` ordering is unchanged.

class Block:
    """
    A structural block with an exact `[start, end)` span into the source.

    `children` holds nested blocks: a `list`/`ordered_list` block's children are its
    `list_item`s, and a `list_item`'s children are ALL its block children (paragraphs,
    nested lists, tables, code, etc.). A `blockquote`'s children are its nested blocks.
    Leaf blocks (heading, code, table, thematic_break, etc.) have no children. `span` is
    trimmed of surrounding whitespace, so `source[start:end]` is the block's exact text.

    `tight` carries CommonMark list density for `list`/`ordered_list` blocks (`True` when
    items have no blank lines between them), and is `None` for every other block type.
    The block tree is density-invariant: a loose list still decomposes into one list
    block with the same `list_item` children as its tight form, so `tight` records the
    spacing without changing the structure or the tallies.

    `code_info`, `table_info`, `list_info`, and `heading_info` carry typed,
    parser-authoritative metadata (see `block_info`): each is non-`None` only for its block
    kind (`code` / `table` / `list`/`ordered_list` / `heading`). They are derived facts
    about the same source span, so they do not participate in equality or `repr` (a block's
    identity is its type/span/children).

    Blocks are frozen and `children` is a tuple, so the cached graph can be shared by
    every structural projection without exposing mutable cache state.
