"""
Sequential base-block partition of a Markdown document.

A base block is a unit of the flat, depth-annotated partition described in
textdoc-spec section 6. The partition is ordered by source position, its spans are
non-overlapping, and together they cover every non-whitespace character of the
document exactly once (the gaps are inter-block and structural whitespace). It is the
view for block-by-block processing and resequencing.

Each base block retains its exact `source_span`, so exact source reconstruction is
available by slicing the source at those spans (or via the structural `blocks()` tree).
Reassembling the rendered base-block *text* is lossy for list-item continuation content:
list markers and continuation indentation are whitespace outside the trimmed spans, so a
naive text concatenation normalizes them. Reconstruct from offsets when exactness matters.

Leaf/atomic blocks (heading, paragraph, table, code, thematic_break, html, and
a whole blockquote) are each one base block. Lists decompose: each list item at every
nesting level is its own base block with increasing depth, and a list item's continuation
content (paragraphs after or between nested sublists) is emitted with its own real block
type at the item's depth — never relabeled `list_item`.
