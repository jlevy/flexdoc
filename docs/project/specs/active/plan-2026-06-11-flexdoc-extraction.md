# Feature: FlexDoc Package Extraction (Staged)

**Date:** 2026-06-11 (last updated 2026-06-12)

**Author:** Joshua Levy

**Status:** Stage 1 shipped (chopdiff, PR #26 merged).
Stage 2 Steps 1–3 (extract + scaffold + verify) and Stage 2.5 (pre-publish design
refinement, from the 2026-06-12 review) are done in this repo, tracked as beads
`flexdoc-7yfb/gvzk/3xhq/hqi1/32s0/ 6a5i/6off/tfg8/mbdt` (closed), plus the 2.5 addendum
(`TextDoc` → `FlexDoc` rename and root entry point; beads `flexdoc-bx3j/jfiq` closed).
The root-surface definition and implementation remain open as beads `flexdoc-l0lc` →
`flexdoc-bift`. Steps 4–5 (publish + rewire chopdiff) are pending.
Stages 3–5 are forward-looking.

## Overview

The document/markdown model that chopdiff grew — `TextDoc`, the block/section/inline
structure, the node table and `DocGraph`, span references, html-in-md, frontmatter — is
a general, reusable *document layer* that does not depend on chopdiff’s diff and
windowed-transform machinery.
This plan extracts it into a standalone package (**flexdoc**) so it can be used and
evolved on its own, and so chopdiff becomes a thin diff/transform layer built **on**
flexdoc.

flexdoc’s north star reaches past the extraction: to be one of the most flexible
foundations in Python for processing and understanding complex documents — for careful
editing and for deep analysis alike.
The aim is to identify and understand a complex Markdown document at a genuinely
granular level along several independent axes at once: its **Markdown syntax** (blocks,
inline elements, exact spans, typed attributes), its **grammar and language**
(paragraphs, sentences, tokens, lemmas, and further linguistic structure), and, where
useful, **other structures** layered onto the same text (marked-up regions, citations,
annotations). That granularity is what enables the use cases driving this work: deep
textual analysis, source-grounded annotation and cleanup of documents, and structural
editing that survives reparse.
The package extraction is the enabling first step; the forward design (Stage 3) is where
flexdoc grows into that role, on the layered model the unified-document-model plan has
already settled (see North star below).

The work is split into stages, each on its own branch (and, from Stage 2, its own repo):

1. **Stage 1 — in-repo refactor (done, in chopdiff).** A pure, behavior-preserving split
   into two import roots (`src/flexdoc/` and `src/chopdiff/`) shipped in a single wheel,
   proving and *enforcing* a one-way dependency cut (`flexdoc` imports nothing from
   `chopdiff`).
2. **Stage 2 — extract and publish (this repo).** Lift `src/flexdoc/` and its tests into
   a standalone package, give it its own packaging and dependency subset, publish to
   PyPI, then rewire chopdiff to depend on it (the single intended breaking release).
   **Stage 2.5** sits between extraction and publish: the pre-publish design refinement
   driven by the standalone review, taken now because breaking changes are free before
   0.1.0 (chopdiff adapts once, at rewire).
3. **Stage 3 — flexdoc as a first-class, extensible document-layer API** (later).
4. **Stage 4 — fold in the synthetic layer** (optional, later).
5. **Stage 5 — standalone cleanup and polish** (the immediate post-extraction tidy; see
   the final phase).

## Goals

- **A self-contained document-layer API.** `flexdoc` is the markdown/document model
  (parse → `TextDoc`/`DocGraph`, `collect()`, spans/`SpanRef`, sections, frontmatter,
  render, html-in-md), usable with no dependency on chopdiff.
- **Granular, multi-axis understanding.** Expose a document’s structure at a fine grain
  across independent axes — Markdown syntax, linguistic structure, and other layered
  structures — over one shared, source-grounded coordinate space.
- **Flexible and extensible by construction.** New parse layers, node kinds, typed
  attributes, and analyzers are additive; they extend the model without reshaping its
  core.
- **A correct, enforced one-way boundary (Stage 1).** `flexdoc` never imports
  `chopdiff`; `chopdiff` imports `flexdoc`. Enforced in Stage 1 by a dependency-free
  test; in Stage 2 the boundary becomes structural (flexdoc has no chopdiff dependency
  at all).
- **A mechanical, low-risk split and release (Stage 2).** With the boundary proven,
  giving `flexdoc` its own `pyproject.toml`, repo, dependency subset, and PyPI release
  is a lift-and-shift; chopdiff’s switch to the external `flexdoc` is the single
  intended breaking release.

## Non-Goals

- **No behavior or API changes in Stages 1–2.** Module locations and import paths move;
  the public behavior of the document model does not.
- **No synthetic-layer / `divs` fold-in now.** Re-expressing `divs`/`TextNode` as
  flexdoc’s synthetic layer is Stage 4.
- **No backward-compatibility shims.** Old `chopdiff.docs.*` paths are not aliased; the
  break lands intentionally in chopdiff’s Stage 2 release.
- **No heavy analysis dependencies in the core.** Linguistic/NLP, layout, and
  domain-specific analysis attach through optional, pluggable analyzers and extras;
  flexdoc’s base model keeps its current light dependency set (and the supply-chain
  cool-off).

## Background

### The dependency graph decides the cut

Mapping the internal imports across chopdiff’s five top-level modules made the boundary
almost entirely forced, not a matter of taste:

- `docs/` ↔ `html/` are **mutually dependent** (`docs/sizes.py` imports
  `html.html_plaintext`; `html/timestamps.py` imports
  `docs.search_tokens`/`docs.wordtoks`), so they stay on the same side.
- `util/` imports nothing internal (a leaf) and `docs/` depends on it, so `util/`
  follows `docs/`.
- `{docs, html, util}` is **closed**: nothing in it imports `divs` or `transforms`. This
  is the flexdoc cluster.
- `transforms/` depends only on `docs` + `util` (both flexdoc) and nothing imports it —
  the chopdiff side.
- `divs/` is a **pure consumer** (imports `docs` + `html`; nothing depends on it), so it
  can sit on either side.
  Resolved: stays in chopdiff (see Resolved Decisions).

A consequence of moving whole modules to preserve code: `docs/token_diffs.py` — the diff
*primitives* — travels into flexdoc with the rest of `docs/`, because it is cyclically
tied to `docs.text_doc`. So flexdoc carries the token-diff *algorithm*; chopdiff keeps
the diff *filters* and windowed transforms.
Relocating `token_diffs` later is a separate finer refactor (Stage 3 candidate).

### The module cut

| Module | Destination | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/` | **flexdoc** | The document model core; mutually dependent with `html/`. |
| `html/` | **flexdoc** | html-in-md/plaintext/tags/extractor/timestamps; cycle with `docs/`. |
| `util/` | **flexdoc** | Leaf utilities `docs/` depends on (read-time, token estimation). |
| `transforms/` | **chopdiff** | Diff filters + windowed transforms; depend on flexdoc. |
| `divs/` | **chopdiff** | Pure consumer; becomes flexdoc’s synthetic layer at Stage 4. |

`lemmatize` was moved out of flexdoc into `chopdiff.util` in Stage 1 (PR #26) — it is
used only by the diff filters, not the document model — so `simplemma` is chopdiff’s
optional extra, not flexdoc’s, keeping the flexdoc core dependency-light.

### Dependency partition (verified)

flexdoc’s runtime dependencies, partitioned from chopdiff and **verified against the
merged Stage-1 tree** in this repo:

```
prettyfmt  flowmark  marko  strif  funlog  cydifflib  regex
selectolax  pydantic  frontmatter-format  typing-extensions
```

Verification notes (these tripped up the naive form of the check; re-verify the same
way):

- **`selectolax` is imported function-locally** in `src/flexdoc/html/html_tags.py`
  (`from selectolax.parser import HTMLParser` inside functions).
  A scan anchored to column-0 `^(from|import)` misses it.
  Use a scan that also catches indented imports before concluding a package is unused.
- **`typing-extensions` is a direct import** (`from typing_extensions import override`,
  five modules) for Python 3.11 support, so it is declared explicitly rather than relied
  on transitively via pydantic.
- **`simplemma` is intentionally absent** (lemmatize is now `chopdiff.util`).
- No optional extras.

## Stage 1 — pure in-repo refactor (done, in chopdiff)

One wheel, two import roots, behavior preserved, boundary enforced.
Shipped on chopdiff’s `main` (PR #26). It moved `docs/`/`html/`/`util/` under
`src/flexdoc/`, rewrote `chopdiff.{docs,html,util}` imports to `flexdoc.*` across the
tree, added `tests/test_package_boundary.py` (asserts via `ast`, stdlib only, that no
`src/flexdoc` module imports `chopdiff`), set the wheel target to both roots, and kept
`make lint`/`make test` green.

## Stage 2 — extract flexdoc to its own repo and publish (this repo)

With the boundary proven, this is copy-and-rewire plus packaging.
The partition was computed from the merged Stage-1 tree; **re-verify each fact against
the source before relying on it** (this refinement records the facts as re-verified on
2026-06-12).

### Step 1 — copy the package, tests, examples, and design history (done)

- [x] Copy `src/flexdoc/` verbatim (the whole package: `docs/`, `html/`, `util/`,
  `__init__.py`, `py.typed`). Inline tests (`## Tests` sections) travel with their
  modules.
- [x] Copy the document-model **tests**: `tests/docs/`, `tests/html/`, `tests/golden/`
  (with `documents/`, `expected/`, `README.md`), and `tests/__init__.py`. **Do not**
  copy `tests/test_package_boundary.py` (the boundary becomes a real package
  dependency). `tests/divs/`, `tests/transforms/`, and `tests/util/` stay in chopdiff.
- [x] **Correction to the original runbook:**
  `tests/html/test_html_validation_and_classes.py` was a *mixed* file — one flexdoc test
  (`tag_with_attrs`) plus one chopdiff test (`parse_divs`, importing `chopdiff.divs`).
  Copying `tests/html/` wholesale therefore pulled a cross-boundary import that fails to
  collect in the standalone package.
  The flexdoc test was kept and the divs test dropped (chopdiff retains its copy).
  **General rule:** after copying tests, grep the copied tree for any `chopdiff` import
  and prune or relocate it — do not assume a test directory is purely on one side of the
  cut.
- [x] `tests/test_supply_chain.py` is **repo-agnostic** (it reads
  `pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock`/ the marker doc), so it is copied as-is rather than
  rewritten — a simplification over the original runbook’s “write a fresh one.”
- [x] Copy the flexdoc-only **examples** (`normalized_form.py`, `doc_structure.py`,
  `backfill_timestamps.py`; verified to import only `flexdoc.*`).
  `insert_para_breaks.py` uses `chopdiff.transforms`, so it stays in chopdiff.
  **Correction:** each example’s PEP 723 `# dependencies` block listed `chopdiff`, not
  `flexdoc` (it worked only because flexdoc shipped inside the chopdiff wheel).
  Rewritten to `flexdoc`; two docstrings that described “chopdiff’s” features were
  reframed to flexdoc.
- [x] Copy the **design history**: `docs/flexdoc-spec.md` (design of record), the
  research briefs under `docs/project/research/`, and the plan specs
  `plan-2026-05-29-unified-document-model.md`, `plan-2026-06-11-structural-metadata.md`,
  `plan-2026-05-31-doc-model-refinements.md`, `plan-2026-05-31-golden-doc-testing.md`,
  and this extraction plan.

### Step 2 — scaffold the new repo’s tooling (done)

This repo was bootstrapped from the same `simple-modern-uv` template as chopdiff, so the
Makefile, `devtools/lint.py`, ruff/basedpyright/pytest config, and workflows already
matched closely; the deltas below are what made it flexdoc-specific and
chopdiff-equivalent.

- [x] `pyproject.toml`: `name = "flexdoc"`, `requires-python = ">=3.11,<4.0"`; hatchling
  \+ uv-dynamic-versioning;
  `[tool.hatch.build.targets.wheel] packages = ["src/flexdoc"]`; the 11 runtime
  dependencies above (no extras); the `audit` group (`pip-audit`); and the
  ruff/basedpyright/codespell/pytest config matching chopdiff.
  Removed the scaffold’s `[project.scripts]` entry point (flexdoc is a library, not a
  CLI).
- [x] **Supply-chain cool-off mirrors chopdiff exactly** (so the shared dependencies
  resolve to the same vetted versions and the two repos advance one policy together):
  global `exclude-newer = "2026-05-11T00:00:00Z"`, with per-package exceptions for
  `strif` (2026-05-24), `flowmark` (2026-05-30), and `idna` (2026-05-13).
  `SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md` documents all three plus the one audit-gate ignore.
  A `tests/test_supply_chain.py` guard checks the lock cutoff matches config and that
  every exception is documented.
- [x] **uv resolution-stability gotcha (worth recording):** a per-package
  `exclude-newer` exception does **not** move an already-locked version on its own — uv
  keeps the locked version if it still satisfies constraints.
  The first `uv lock` (under the global 2026-05-11 cutoff) pinned `idna 3.14`; widening
  only idna’s exception left it at 3.14. Forcing the CVE fix required
  `uv lock --upgrade-package idna`, which pulled `idna 3.15` (matching chopdiff).
  With idna fixed, the audit gate ignores only `PYSEC-2026-196` in `pip` (a pip-audit
  tool transitive dep, never shipped), identical to chopdiff.
- [x] `devtools/lint.py`: added `examples` to `SRC_PATHS` (matching chopdiff) so
  examples are linted and type-checked.
- [x] CI (`ci.yml`): `build` (3.11–3.14, `uv sync --locked`, lint `--check`, pytest),
  `audit` (`pip-audit --ignore-vuln PYSEC-2026-196`), and `wheel-smoke` — the smoke job
  imports **only** `flexdoc` from an isolated wheel install (chopdiff’s smoke imported
  both roots). `publish.yml` mirrors chopdiff’s `--locked` (fixed-cutoff) form.
- [x] Fresh `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`; `SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md`; `AGENTS.md`
  carries chopdiff’s engineering guidelines (minus the tbd block, as flexdoc is not a
  tbd repo); `LICENSE` and `.gitignore` from the scaffold.
  `src/flexdoc/__init__.py`’s docstring was corrected (it listed `flexdoc.util` as
  “lemmatization and token estimation”; lemmatize left in Stage 1, so it is now
  “read-time and token-count estimation”) and reframed to describe flexdoc as a
  standalone library.
- [x] `uv lock` (committed) and `make install`.

### Step 3 — verify flexdoc standalone (done)

- [x] `make lint` clean (66 source files, 0 errors) and `make test` green (305 passed —
  the document-model suite, the goldens, and the supply-chain guard).
- [x] `uv build` produces `flexdoc-*.whl` + sdist; isolated-venv smoke test installs the
  wheel and runs
  `import flexdoc; from flexdoc.docs import TextDoc; from flexdoc.html import html_to_plaintext; TextDoc.from_text(...)`.
  The boundary is now structural: flexdoc has no chopdiff dependency at all.

### Stage 2.5 — pre-publish design refinement (between Steps 3 and 4)

Driven by the standalone review
([`senior-engineering-review-flexdoc-standalone-2026-06.md`](../../review/senior-engineering-review-flexdoc-standalone-2026-06.md)),
which re-verified the v0.3.1 review’s findings as fixed and identified the remaining
first-release hygiene.
Taken **before** 0.1.0 because this is the one window where breaking changes are free:
nothing is published, and chopdiff adapts once at rewire (Step 5). The constraint is the
client compatibility bar from the maintainer: the refined library must be at least as
capable as what chopdiff ships today; renames and removals are fine, capability
regressions are not.
Every item keeps `make lint`/`make test` green and the golden fixtures unchanged (these
are Python-surface changes, not parse-behavior changes).

Breaking cleanups (done first, they shape the 0.1.0 surface):

- [x] **Drop the deprecated `collect()` aliases** (review F1): `scope` (also positional)
  and `contains` removed from `flexdoc.docs.collect.collect` and the `TextDoc.collect`
  bridge; both fully keyword-only.
  Alias tests rewritten to `subtree_of`/`within`; the alias-error cases removed.
- [x] **Close the editing-view naming seam** (review F3): `TextDoc.block_at_offset` →
  `paragraph_at_offset`, `iter_blocks` → `iter_paragraphs`,
  `Section.own_blocks`/`subtree_blocks` → `own_paragraphs`/`subtree_paragraphs`;
  `filtered()` docstring rephrased in paragraph terms; spec/example references updated.
  “Block” now always means the structural layer, “paragraph” the blank-line editing
  view, matching spec §6. chopdiff’s own code was verified to use none of the
  renamed/removed surfaces, so the Step 5 rewire is unaffected.
- [x] **Settle the export surface in one pass** (review F2): `flexdoc.docs` now exports
  the typed block metadata (`CodeInfo`/`TableInfo`/`ListInfo`), the `SpanRef` resolvers
  (`resolve`/`resolve_and_update`), `parse_blocks`/`walk_blocks`/ `block_type_for`, and
  the renamed `DEFAULT_INCLUDE`; `flexdoc.html` exports the missing `html_in_md`
  siblings (`html_p`, `html_tag`, `escape_attribute`, `tag_wrapper`,
  `identity_wrapper`). `IntervalIndex` and `node_table`/`render` internals stay private.
  README needed no changes (its imports were already package-surface).
  Discovered during the split: `_block_links` is a cross-module primitive, so it was
  promoted to public `block_links` in `flexdoc.docs.links` rather than crossing module
  boundaries underscore-named.

Non-breaking refinements (done):

- [x] **Split `text_doc.py`** (review F4): 1312 → 788 lines.
  Editing units moved to `paragraphs.py` (`Paragraph`, `Sentence`, `Offsets`,
  `SentIndex`, splitter hook), link extraction to `links.py` (`Link`, `block_links`),
  `Section` to `sections.py`; `text_doc.py` keeps `TextDoc` and the caching
  infrastructure. The `flexdoc.docs` package surface is unchanged;
  `flexdoc.docs.text_doc` still resolves `TextDoc` (canonical) and the names it itself
  uses.
- [x] **Memoize `sections()`** (review F5) via `_memoized_derivation`
  (`_cached_sections`), returning a fresh shallow copy per call like `blocks()`.
- [x] **Tighten the cross-language contract** (review F6): `AttrValue` JSON-safe alias
  on `Node.attrs`; `NodeModel.attrs` validated as `pydantic.JsonValue` at `DocGraph`
  emission (committed JSON Schema regenerated); a determinism test pins contiguous
  preorder node-id assignment across rebuilds.
- [x] **Enforce `LAYER_NESTING` in `build_node_table`** (review F7): tree layers check
  child-span-within-parent, ordered layers check sibling order/non-overlap; the whole
  golden corpus passes with validation on.

Docs and polish (review P3 sweep, done):

- [x] Spec reframed to flexdoc voice (§3, §6, §8), the stale deprecated-alias note in §9
  removed, the §13 “FlexDoc” naming disambiguation added, and the §15 source-module list
  updated for the split; one-line origin notes added to the four copied plan specs and
  three research briefs.
- [x] `read_time` documented as a downstream convenience (no internal users); the
  Pydantic-at-the-boundary / dataclasses-in-the-core rationale recorded in
  `doc_graph.py`’s module docstring.
- [x] Targeted inline tests added for `escape_attribute` and `html_p`/`html_tag`
  (pinning the p/div default-padding behavior); `render` helpers already had inline
  tests; `visualize_wordtoks` left untested (debug printer, a trivial test adds no
  coverage).
- [x] Explicit non-actions, per the review: no wordtok sentinel redesign, no root-level
  re-exports, no Pydantic/dataclass unification, no `DocumentSnapshot`, no offset
  micro-optimization without a benchmark; the `frontmatter.py` swap to
  `fmf_split_frontmatter_string` stays blocked on the upstream `frontmatter-format`
  release + cool-off exception (maintainer sign-off).

Verified after the stage: `make lint` clean, 305 tests green (goldens unchanged),
examples run, `uv build` + isolated-venv wheel smoke test exercising the new API
(`paragraph_at_offset`, settled exports) passes.

### Stage 2.5 addendum (2026-06-12): `TextDoc` → `FlexDoc` and the root entry point

Maintainer-decided after a naming review: the package’s central class should carry the
package’s name. The deciding argument is that the two names’ accuracy trends in opposite
directions — `TextDoc` gets more wrong as the annotation/synthetic/layout layers land,
`FlexDoc` gets more right — and the pre-publish window plus the pending chopdiff rewire
makes this the one nearly-free moment for the rename.
The known caveat is recorded honestly: `FlexDoc` slightly over-promises on editing (only
the textual layer is mutable; structural layers are read-only projections until the
cross-layer edit phases), which the class docstring’s contract addresses.

- [x] **Rename `TextDoc` → `FlexDoc`** (bead `flexdoc-bx3j`), executed with
  `uvx repren@latest` in three literal passes (`TextDoc`→`FlexDoc`,
  `text_doc`→`flex_doc`, `textdoc-spec`→`flexdoc-spec`): class, module (`flex_doc.py`;
  `test_flex_doc.py` follows), and the design of record (`docs/flexdoc-spec.md`,
  retitled “FlexDoc and DocGraph”). Spec §13 rewritten to deliberately **reclaim the
  name** from the abandoned `BlockDoc`/`SectionDoc` branch that coincidentally also used
  “FlexDoc”: today the name means only this class.
  History docs (the review, copied plans/briefs) keep their `TextDoc` prose as
  historical record; only spec path references were updated.
  Goldens and the DocGraph wire format are name-free (verified) and unchanged; the JSON
  Schema was regenerated (one embedded docstring reference).
  Tests now import `FlexDoc` from the package surface; src-internal imports stay
  module-direct.

- [x] **Root entry point** (bead `flexdoc-jfiq`): `from flexdoc import FlexDoc` works;
  the root `__init__` docstring now presents it as the primary entry point; README’s
  example uses the root import; the CI wheel-smoke job and a contract test
  (`tests/test_root_api.py`) pin root-vs-canonical identity and the exact root
  `__all__`. This amends Stage 5’s earlier “submodule-only” stance by maintainer
  decision.

- [x] **Root-level API surface, defined and implemented** (beads `flexdoc-l0lc`,
  `flexdoc-bift`; maintainer-directed 2026-06-12, designed against the two checked-out
  downstream users in `attic/`). The root exports the working set:
  `FlexDoc`, `DocGraph`, `Detail`, `SpanRef`, `BlockType`, `NodeKind`, `Layer`,
  `TextUnit`. Evidence: chopdiff's imports are dominated by `FlexDoc`/`TextUnit`/
  `BlockType`; practical-prose-style document evaluation needs textual-layer metrics
  (`TextUnit`), `SpanRef` annotation of exact sentences, and `DocGraph` with `Detail`
  payloads for source-linked UI rendering. Criteria held: a symbol earns root placement
  only if it appears in the first lines of typical use. Exclusions, deliberate: unit
  types (`Paragraph`/`Sentence`/`Section`/`Block`/`Node`) are reached from a parsed
  doc, not imported; `resolve`/`resolve_and_update` keep module context in
  `flexdoc.docs` (bare `resolve` at root is too generic); the free `collect` (the
  method covers it); `DEFAULT_INCLUDE`; wordtok/diff machinery and html helpers stay
  submodule-only. Also: the render helpers (`render_node_attrs`,
  `wrap_with_node_attrs`, `parse_source_span_attr`) became public in `flexdoc.docs`,
  since the source-linked UI flow the spec §12 describes depends on them.
  `tests/test_root_api.py` pins identity and the exact surface.

- [x] **Spec revision to a standalone definitive reference** (maintainer notes
  2026-06-12; beads `flexdoc-x1iw`, `flexdoc-moqm`, `flexdoc-ldo4`): all decision-record
  (`DR-x`/`E9`), epic, and plan references stripped so the spec defines its own terms
  and other plans reference *it*; a Terminology section
  (sizes/words/approximate-LLM-token estimates first; `wordtok` defined as the
  lower-level lexical unit); the synthetic layer redefined from first principles
  (configured XML-style tag whitelist — hyphenated extension tags, `div`/`span`, comment
  directives — compositional with future layers) instead of by reference to divs; §4 and
  §7 rewritten to define their components rigorously; an “Error posture” principle
  (lenient deterministic input, visible degradation, strict internal contracts, opt-in
  strictness) with per-layer error-handling subsections ending each layer’s coverage,
  including the document layer’s handling of headingless, malformed-heading, and
  unstructured documents; §14 made an honest implemented-vs-specified ledger, with the
  synthetic-layer migration mapped in Stage 4 (bead `flexdoc-t5rh`) and summarized in
  the new `TODO.md`.

Re-verified after the addendum: `make lint` clean, 307 tests green (goldens still
unchanged), examples run, isolated-venv wheel smoke via the root import passes.
chopdiff’s Step 5 rewire gains the class rename (46 occurrences across 7 files,
mechanical) in the same already-breaking release; the migration note is one pass:
`chopdiff.docs.TextDoc` → `flexdoc.FlexDoc`.

### Step 4 — publish flexdoc (pending; maintainer-gated; after Stage 2.5)

- [ ] Land Stage 2.5 first, so 0.1.0’s first published API is the refined one (no
  deprecated aliases, settled exports, closed naming seam) and chopdiff’s rewire targets
  the final names in one pass.
- [ ] Confirm the distribution name `flexdoc` is available on PyPI — verified available
  2026-06-12 (pypi.org returns 404 for `flexdoc`); re-check at publish time.
  Resolve the flexdoc-spec §13 name collision (Stage 2.5 / Open Questions).
  Configure the PyPI Trusted Publisher for `jlevy/flexdoc` (`docs/publishing.md`).
- [ ] Tag and publish `flexdoc 0.1.0` (its own version line) via `publish.yml`.
  Publishing is irreversible; it is the maintainer’s call to trigger.

### Step 5 — rewire chopdiff to the external flexdoc (pending; the breaking release)

- [ ] In chopdiff: `git rm -r src/flexdoc/` and the moved tests
  (`tests/{docs,html,golden}/`, `tests/test_package_boundary.py`); keep
  `tests/{divs,transforms,util}/`. The `chopdiff.{transforms,divs,util}` code already
  imports `flexdoc.*`, so **no import rewrite is needed** — those imports now resolve to
  the external package.
  (Note: the `tests/html/...validation_and_classes` divs test that flexdoc dropped stays
  valid in chopdiff, which still has `chopdiff.divs`.)
- [ ] `pyproject.toml`: add `flexdoc>=<first published>`; **remove** the
  now-flexdoc-only deps (`marko`, `cydifflib`, `funlog`, `regex`, `strif`,
  `frontmatter-format`, `pydantic`, `selectolax`, and the `typing-extensions` that
  flexdoc now owns directly); **keep** `flowmark` and `prettyfmt` (used directly by
  `transforms`/`divs`) and the `simplemma` extra (used by `chopdiff.util.lemmatize`).
  Set the wheel target back to `["src/chopdiff"]`. `uv lock`.
- [ ] `make lint`/`make test` green against the published flexdoc; the chopdiff
  `wheel-smoke` now imports only `chopdiff` (with `flexdoc` pulled as a dependency).
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md`: chopdiff’s first release depending on external flexdoc — a
  **breaking** release (the `chopdiff.docs|html|util.*` paths are gone).
  Note the migration (`pip install flexdoc`; `chopdiff.docs.* -> flexdoc.docs.*`).
  Merging/releasing is the maintainer’s call.

## North star: a layered, extensible document model

What makes flexdoc flexible is a shape: a **stable node table over a single
source-grounded coordinate space**, with the document’s many structures expressed as
**independent, composable parse layers** rather than one privileged tree.
This is the architecture the design of record (`docs/flexdoc-spec.md`, principles P1–P5)
and the unified-document-model plan settled, much of which already ships.
The granularity the vision asks for falls out of three properties:

- **One coordinate space, many layers.** Every layer anchors to the same
  Unicode-code-point offsets; a node is
  `{id, kind, layer, parent, children, source_span, attrs}`. Layers coexist by span, so
  overlapping/cross-cutting structures are all representable without forcing one
  hierarchy.
- **One query, any grain.** A single `collect()` primitive — by `kinds`/`where`, by
  within-layer subtree, or by cross-layer offset-containment (`within`/`overlaps`),
  restricted by `layer` — answers everything; values, counts, and relationships are
  ordinary Python over the result.
- **One reference type.** `SpanRef` (quote-canonical, offset-hinted) anchors annotations
  and edits to the text so they survive reparse.

The three axes map onto layers, each an **extension axis, not a fixed schema**: Markdown
syntax (`markdown` layer, most complete), grammar/language (`textual` + optional
analyzers), and other structures (`synthetic`/`annotation`/`layout`). Two principles
keep this flexible without becoming heavy: **keep the core light, make enrichment
pluggable** (heavier analysis attaches through an analyzer interface as optional
extras), and **extend by adding layers and kinds, never by reshaping the core**.

## Stage 3 — flexdoc as a first-class, extensible document-layer API (later)

This is where flexdoc takes up its role; thorough and careful, detailed in flexdoc’s own
forthcoming specs rather than frozen here.

- [ ] Settle and document flexdoc’s public surface (including the deferred root-level
  re-exports) as one coherent document-layer API.
- [ ] Make the driving use cases first-class and tested — deep textual analysis,
  source-grounded annotation/cleanup, reparse-stable editing — with worked examples.
- [ ] Land the remaining unified-document-model phases (annotation, cross-layer edits,
  layout) in flexdoc; the model core already ships (flexdoc-spec §14).
- [ ] Add the optional **analyzer interface** for the grammar/language axis (opt-in
  backends, light core preserved); deepen the Markdown and other-structure axes as
  needed.
- [ ] Document the extension contract (add a `Layer`/`NodeKind`/`attrs`/analyzer);
  revisit `token_diffs` placement.

## Stage 4 — fold in the synthetic layer (later; mapped 2026-06-12)

Re-express marker-tag regions as flexdoc’s synthetic layer, per the spec’s
first-principles definition (`docs/flexdoc-spec.md` §3): a configured whitelist of
XML-style tags (custom hyphenated extension tags, `<div>`/`<span>`, comment directives)
whose regions become nodes keyed into the node table.
Tracked as bead `flexdoc-t5rh`. Today’s implementation lives in chopdiff
(`chopdiff.divs`: `TextNode`, `parse_divs`, chunk utilities) as a standalone subsystem
not keyed into the node table.

The concrete step map (moderate difficulty; no node-table/`collect()`/schema changes
expected — the `synthetic` `Layer` value is already reserved):

- [ ] Move `chopdiff.divs` into flexdoc (module move + import rewrite), with
  `tests/divs/` following; chopdiff then imports it from flexdoc (a breaking chopdiff
  change, foldable into a planned release).
- [ ] Add a synthetic-layer builder pass to `build_node_table`: scan the configured tag
  whitelist over `source_text`, emit one `Layer.synthetic` node per well-formed region
  with tag name/attributes in `attrs`; tags outside the whitelist are inert (spec §3).
- [ ] **Decide the overlap policy** (the one open design point, spec §3 error handling):
  regions that fail to nest either get dropped leniently (text remains, no node) or the
  layer’s `LAYER_NESTING` guarantee relaxes to `ordered_list`. Whichever is chosen is
  then enforced by the existing build-time validation.
- [ ] Fixtures for the hard cases: unclosed marker tags (no region; visible as inline
  HTML), regions crossing block boundaries (cross-layer overlap queries must answer
  correctly), nested same-tag regions, and comment-directive form.
- [ ] Golden coverage: extend the corpus with a marker-tag document so the synthetic
  layer’s docgraph/report output is pinned like the other layers.

Effort estimate: the move is mechanical; the builder pass and overlap-policy fixtures
are the real work — on the order of one focused stage, comparable to Stage 2.5’s
mid-size items, assuming the lenient-drop policy (the guarantee-relaxation variant costs
more because ordered-list projection of regions needs its own view decisions).

## Stage 5 — standalone cleanup and polish (final phase)

The immediate post-extraction tidy: small, behavior-preserving improvements that make
flexdoc clean *as its own package*, separate from Stage 3’s larger forward design.
None of these change the public model’s behavior; they remove chopdiff-era residue and
tighten the standalone surface.
Most can land before or alongside Stage 3.

- [x] **Purge stale `chopdiff` references in flexdoc prose** (catalogued during the
  extraction; all were cosmetic, none functional): the `text_doc.py` markup-check
  comment, the `block_tree.py` block-boundary docstring, the `test_block_types.py`
  offset comment, and the `doc_structure.py` sample prose now say flexdoc.
  The one remaining mention — `flexdoc/__init__.py` noting that chopdiff builds on
  flexdoc — is deliberate, describing the package relationship.
- [x] **Decide flexdoc’s top-level public surface (superseded 2026-06-12).** Initially
  resolved as “keep submodule-only,” matching the docstring’s design-once intent.
  Amended by maintainer decision with the `FlexDoc` rename: the root now exports the
  single entry point (`from flexdoc import FlexDoc`; see the Stage 2.5 addendum), and
  the *full* root surface is defined deliberately via beads `flexdoc-l0lc` (definition,
  gating) and `flexdoc-bift` (implementation).
- [x] **Resolve the FlexDoc naming collision / trim the design-history docs** — moved
  into Stage 2.5’s docs-and-polish sweep, since both must land before 0.1.0 publishes.
- [ ] **Audit docstrings/`README` examples** for correctness against the standalone API
  (the import-path portion lands with Stage 2.5’s export pass) and add a couple of
  runnable examples specific to flexdoc’s use cases.
- [ ] **Revisit `token_diffs` placement** (kept in flexdoc by the `docs` cycle) and
  whether the `tests/html/...validation_and_classes` file should be renamed now that its
  div-class test is gone.

## Testing Strategy

- **Stage 1 acceptance:** the existing inline + `tests/` suite passes unchanged after
  the moves and import rewrites, plus the boundary test and a one-wheel/two-root build
  smoke check.
- **Stage 2:** flexdoc’s suite passes standalone (305 tests here), `make lint` clean,
  the wheel imports from an isolated install; after Step 5, chopdiff’s suite passes
  against the published flexdoc; both repos green in CI.
- **Stages 3–5:** per the unified-document-model plan and flexdoc’s own forthcoming
  specs; Stage 5 cleanups must keep `make lint`/`make test` green and the goldens
  unchanged.

## Rollout Plan

- **Stage 1** shipped nothing (unreleased refactor inside chopdiff); it is the
  correctness gate for everything after.
- **Stage 2** publishes flexdoc on its own version line (starting at `0.1.0`), then
  makes chopdiff’s first release depending on the external flexdoc — **breaking**,
  because the document-model import paths moved (`chopdiff.docs.*` → `flexdoc.*`);
  flagged in chopdiff’s `CHANGELOG.md` with a migration note under the pre-1.0
  minor-bump policy.
- Each repo keeps its own supply-chain `exclude-newer` cool-off, kept in sync.

## Resolved Decisions

- **One-wheel / two-import-root layout for Stage 1** (maintainer-confirmed).
- **The cut is forced by the import graph.** `{docs, html, util}` → flexdoc;
  `transforms` → chopdiff; only `divs` was a free choice.
- **`divs/` stays in chopdiff** (chunking matches chopdiff’s identity; keeps flexdoc a
  minimal closed core), to migrate into flexdoc as the synthetic layer at Stage 4.
- **Whole-module moves, no logic edits**; `token_diffs` travels into flexdoc as a
  consequence of the `docs` cycle.
- **No backward-compatibility shims.** The break lands intentionally in chopdiff’s Stage
  2 release.
- **Boundary enforced by a dependency-free test** (Stage 1); structural in Stage 2.
- **flexdoc dependency partition verified** (11 runtime deps; `selectolax` confirmed via
  the function-local import; `typing-extensions` declared directly; `simplemma`
  excluded).
- **Supply-chain config mirrors chopdiff** (same cutoff and exceptions; idna fixed to
  3.15 via `uv lock --upgrade-package`; audit gate ignores only the pip advisory).

## Open Questions

- **flexdoc distribution name.** Confirm `flexdoc` is available on PyPI before Step 4
  (verified available 2026-06-12; re-check at publish).
  The spec §13 name collision is resolved: the name was deliberately reclaimed for the
  `FlexDoc` class (Stage 2.5 addendum).
- **`token_diffs` long-term home.** Forced into flexdoc for v1 by the `docs` cycle;
  whether to relocate the diff primitives later is open (Stage 3).
- **flexdoc’s root API surface beyond `FlexDoc`.** The entry point is root-exported;
  which further symbols earn root placement is the open definition task (bead
  `flexdoc-l0lc`, gating `flexdoc-bift`), feeding Stage 3’s full surface design.
- **Depth and backends of the grammar/language axis**, **which “other structures” to
  prioritize**, and **the extension-interface shape** — flexdoc Stage-3 decisions,
  constrained by the light-core and supply-chain principles.
