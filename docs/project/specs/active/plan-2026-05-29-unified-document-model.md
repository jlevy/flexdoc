# Feature: A Flexible Unified Document Model (DocGraph)

*Authored in [chopdiff](https://github.com/jlevy/chopdiff) and copied here at the
flexdoc extraction (Stage 2); kept as design history for the document model.*

**Date:** 2026-05-29 (last updated 2026-05-30)

**Author:** chopdiff maintainers

**Status:** **Phases 0–2 implemented; Phases 3–4 deferred to after the FlexDoc
separation.** All nine decisions are settled (2026-05-29 / 2026-05-30): decision records
DR-1..DR-6 cover the architecture (node table; `DocGraph` projection; Pydantic
authoring; one `collect()` rollup primitive; composable `include` layers; the `SpanRef`
span-reference type), plus 6 (minimal phase-1 scope), 8 (lazy-cache), 9 (count list-item
wrapper paragraphs).
The **layered-parsing lens (E9, 2026-05-30)** is folded in as a consolidating frame: it
validates DR-1..DR-6, adds four cheap Phase-1 hooks (node `layer` field,
offset-containment queries, per-layer nesting guarantee, `SpanRef`-anchored edits),
unifies the `Layer` vocabulary, and names later Phases 3–4 (synthetic layer; cross-layer
structural edits).

**Implementation status (2026-06-12):** **Phases 0–2 shipped; Phases 3–4 deferred to
post-separation.** The document-model core is built: the recursive, layer-tagged node
table, `base_blocks()`, the single `collect()` query (with
`subtree_of`/`within`/`overlaps` relations), the `DocGraph/v0.1` Pydantic projection,
and the `SpanRef` contract (`from_node`/`from_span`/`resolve` with exact + quote-based
re-anchoring, `to_persisted`, and Chrome text-fragment export; fuzzy/edit-distance
re-anchoring deferred).
The markdown layer was then completed: typed `CodeInfo`/`TableInfo`/`ListInfo`,
`NodeKind.footnote_ref`, and `TextDoc.frontmatter`. This shipped in v0.3.1 and the
subsequent markdown-completion work.
**Phase 3 (the synthetic layer) and Phase 4 (cross-layer edits, the annotation stand-off
layer, operation/provenance/layout) are not built and are deliberately deferred until
after the FlexDoc package is separated into its own repo:** the synthetic layer’s only
source (`divs`/`TextNode`) stays in chopdiff until the extraction plan
([`plan-2026-06-11-flexdoc-extraction.md`](plan-2026-06-11-flexdoc-extraction.md)) Stage
4 migrates it into the flexdoc repo, so building it now would re-couple the two
packages. Tracked by epic `chopdiff-8q8q`.

## Overview

We want a single, source-grounded, JSON-serializable representation of a *fully
processed* document from which we can cheaply derive any view (the exact original
structure, the section tree, the block tree, inline items) and any **rollup**, of either
**values** (the items themselves) or **counts**, at any scope (document, section, or
block), recursively, including inline items and the relationships between blocks and
inline items. The model should serialize cleanly for frontend UIs and support a few
**optional levels of detail** so it need not always be large.

The research concludes, and this plan adopts, that the durable shape is **not a single
tree** but a **stable node set addressable by id, plus typed layers and derived views**.
Sections cross-cut block containment, links are inline ranges, annotations are
arbitrary; a single hierarchy cannot hold all of them, but a node table with span/id
addressing makes every tree, slice, and rollup a cheap projection.
`TextDoc` remains the Python core; **`DocGraph`** is the serialized, language-neutral
projection.

## Goals

- One **unified JSON schema** (`DocGraph`) for the fully processed document, reusable
  and serializable into frontend UIs.
- Recover the **exact original document structure** (containment tree) *and* the
  **section tree** as derived views of the same node set.
- **Flexible rollups** with no precommitment: values *or* counts, scoped to document /
  section / block, recursive or shallow, over blocks *and* inline items.
- First-class **inline items** (links, code spans, images, …) and **block↔inline
  relationships** (which inline items live in which block / sentence / section).
- **Slice by section** for every view and rollup.
- **Optional levels of detail** so a caller can ask for a small structural overview or a
  full dump.
- Stay within the design-of-record principles: source canonical, derived views, **no
  stored counts**, additive to `TextDoc`.

## Non-Goals

- A parallel runtime Python document model competing with `TextDoc` (the research is
  explicit: extend `TextDoc`; `DocGraph` is a projection/contract).
- Live collaborative editing, CRDForms, or a rich-text editor model as canonical (client
  edge only; keep an opaque `anchor` slot open).
- Perfect byte-for-byte source-preserving Markdown surgery (normalized rewrite is the
  first writeback target).
- New parser/editor dependencies in this phase (Marko/flowmark only; djot is a
  documented fallback).
  Follow `SUPPLY-CHAIN-SECURITY.md`.
- Layout/PDF geometry, annotations, and operation/provenance layers as *built* features
  now; the schema reserves slots for them, but they are later phases.

## Background

Where we are after v0.3.1:

- `TextDoc` is source-referenced (paragraph/sentence spans), block-aware
  (`TextDoc.blocks()` structural tree via flowmark spans), section-aware
  (`sections()`/`toc()`), and link-aware (`links()` with recovered spans).
- Tallies exist but are **top-level only**: `block_type_counts()` does not descend into
  blockquotes/list-items, returns counts (not values or locations together), and
  `Section.blocks()` re-parses the whole document per section.
  (This is the gap `plan-2026-05-29-multilevel-block-tallies.md` opened; it is folded in
  here.)
- The structural tree is a pure function of the immutable `source_text`, so caching is
  safe; flowmark already exposes every nested block with a span, so the full recursive
  structure is one walk away.

What the research adds: model ≠ format ≠ implementation; pin coordinates (Unicode code
points) and ids; stand-off layering as the conceptual core; red-green (immutable nodes +
computed position, trivia first-class) as the structural-tree pattern; “zoom and views
are one requirement.”

**Prerequisite: robustness hardening.** This plan builds on `TextDoc`’s offsets,
sub-document slicing, and transforms.
Phase 1 of
[`plan-2026-05-26-robustness-hardening.md`](plan-2026-05-26-robustness-hardening.md)
should land first: `sub_doc`/`sub_paras` currently alias caller objects (the node
table/`SpanRef` model wants safe copies), `filtered_transform` can skip its filter, and
div chunking mis-slices.
The doc-model’s source-grounding assumptions (exact spans, honest `from_text`
normalization) are already satisfied in v0.3.1.

## Requirements (from the Request)

1. Rollups at **any time** of **values or counts**, not overly constrained.
2. Scoped around **blocks** or the **whole document**, and **by section**.
3. **Recursively** collect blocks **and inline item values**, and the **relationships**
   between blocks and inline items.
4. The **full recursive structure** available when needed.
5. Ideally a **tree document** whose section structure can be broken into the **exact
   original structure** *or* **any rollup**.
6. Likely a **single unified JSON schema** for the fully processed document, reusable
   and **serializable to frontend UIs**.
7. **A few optional levels of detail** so it is not always large.
8. **A consistent reference/annotation model across source, parsed model, and rendered
   output.** It must be easy to reference a piece of the document (a line/span in the
   original source, a *parsed element* (a table, a link), or a region in *rendered*
   content) using one scheme.
   References made against parsed elements must resolve down to the original source;
   **persisted** references must be **source-grounded** (the saved form references the
   original document); **in-memory/editor** references may use the tree but must
   round-trip to source on save and re-resolve to nodes on load/reparse.

# Exploration

Each subsection states the question, the realistic options, pros/cons, and a leaning;
the settled choices are recorded under “Decisions” and the Decision Record.

## E1. One Tree, or a Node Set with Derived Trees?

The request asks for a “tree document … broken down into the exact original structure or
any rollup.” The instinct is a single tree.
The research argues against a single canonical tree.

- **Option 1a:** one canonical tree (blocks), sections as an overlay.
  The block containment tree is canonical; sections are computed from heading levels and
  reference block ids.
  - *Pros:* matches intuition; the “exact original structure” is literally the tree;
    simple mental model.
  - *Cons:* sections cross-cut block containment (a section spans many sibling blocks
    and stops mid-stream at the next heading), so the section tree is *not* a subtree of
    the block tree; it must be an overlay anyway.
    Inline items and annotations are ranges, not tree nodes.
    So “one tree” silently becomes “one tree plus overlays.”
- **Option 1b:** a stable node set (table) addressable by id and span, with every tree
  and slice as a derived view (research’s recommendation).
  Nodes carry `parent`/`children` for the containment tree; the section tree, block
  list, inline index, and rollups are projections sharing node ids.
  - *Pros:* the exact containment tree *and* the section tree *and* any rollup are all
    cheap projections of one set; overlapping/cross-cutting layers (sections, links,
    annotations) are natural; “zoom = pick a view and level” falls out; serializes to
    one JSON.
  - *Cons:* one more indirection than a bare tree; need discipline on ids and span
    units.

**Leaning: 1b, presented so the tree intuition is preserved as a view.** The user’s
“tree that breaks down into exact structure or any rollup” is exactly 1b’s
containment-tree projection plus rollup projections: we get the tree *and* the
flexibility, instead of choosing.
The JSON still *looks* tree-shaped at the top (a `document` root with children), so
consumers that just want the tree ignore the extra indexes.

## E2. Canonical Store: Extend `TextDoc`, or a Standalone Object?

- **Option 2a:** `DocGraph` is purely a serialized projection, built on demand from
  `TextDoc` (and its block tree, sections, links).
  No new long-lived runtime object; `TextDoc` stays the core.
  - *Pros:* matches the research ("extend TextDoc; DocGraph is the contract"); no
    parallel model to keep in sync; reuses spans/sections/links already built.
  - *Cons:* the projection logic lives somewhere (a builder); repeated builds cost
    unless cached.
- **Option 2b:** a first-class `DocGraph` runtime object that owns the node table and is
  the primary API.
  - *Pros:* one object to pass around; natural home for query methods.
  - *Cons:* a second document model competing with `TextDoc`; the research explicitly
    warns against this until a runtime boundary requires it.

**Leaning: 2a, with a thin builder and lazy cache.** Build the node table once from
`TextDoc` (lazily, keyed to the immutable `source_text`), expose query/rollup methods
over it, and serialize to the JSON schema.
No competing model.

## E3. Rollups: Derived Queries vs Materialized Indexes; Values vs Counts

The requirement is “values *or* counts, any scope, recursive, blocks and inline.”
The unifying primitive is a **scoped, typed collection of nodes**; counts are `len`,
values are the nodes (each with span, text, attrs).

- **Option 3a:** pure derived queries (`collect(scope, kinds, recursive)` walks the node
  set each call).
  - *Pros:* maximally flexible and uncommitted (the request’s “don’t overly constrain”);
    no stored counts; always current.
  - *Cons:* repeated walks; per-section re-walk cost (mitigated once the tree is
    cached).
- **Option 3b:** materialized per-scope indexes (precompute `dict[kind, list[node]]` per
  section/block).
  - *Pros:* O(1) repeated lookups.
  - *Cons:* stored derived state to invalidate; violates “no stored counts” in spirit;
    over-commits to particular rollups.
- **Option 3c:** lazy-cached node table and on-demand queries (hybrid).
  Cache the *node set* (expensive part: parse+walk) once; rollups are cheap
  queries/`Counter`s over it, optionally memoized.
  - *Pros:* flexible like 3a, fast like 3b, no premature commitment; “no stored counts”
    holds (counts are derived from the cached node set, not stored).
  - *Cons:* must document the source-text-immutability contract.

**Leaning: 3c.** A single query primitive returns nodes; counts/values/locations are all
read off the result.
Example shape:

```
overview.collect(scope=Scope.section(s_id), kinds={NodeKind.table, NodeKind.link},
                 recursive=True) -> list[Node]        # values (each has .span/.text/.attrs)
overview.counts(scope=..., recursive=True) -> Counter[NodeKind]   # = Counter(n.kind for n in collect)
```

## E4. Inline Items and Block↔Inline Relationships

Inline items (links, code spans, images, emphasis…) are ranges inside a block, not
block-tree children.
Two ways to relate them:

- **Option 4a:** inline items are nodes in the same table, with `parent` = containing
  block and a derived `section`/`sentence` association; block↔inline relationship is
  just parent/ancestor lookup and span containment.
  - *Pros:* one addressing scheme; “links in section 3” = scoped collect; relationships
    are graph edges already present (parent/ancestor, span-contains).
  - *Cons:* inline nodes may lack exact spans for some cases (reference links); store
    `span=None` with identity, as `links()` already does.
- **Option 4b:** inline items live only in a separate `links`/`inline` view, related by
  storing block id on each.
  - *Pros:* keeps the block tree purely block-level.
  - *Cons:* a second addressing scheme; relationship queries become bespoke.

**Leaning: 4a.** Inline items are nodes (`kind` in an `inline` family) with `parent`
block and computed containing-sentence/section; this makes “recursively collect blocks
**and** inline item values, and the relationships between them” a single mechanism.

## E5. Levels of Detail

A caller should choose how much to materialize/serialize.
Options for the axis:

- **Option 5a:** cumulative levels (`STRUCTURE ⊂ INLINE ⊂ TEXT ⊂ ANALYSIS ⊂ FULL`). Each
  level adds fields/layers.
  - *Pros:* simple to explain ("give me level 2"); predictable size growth.
  - *Cons:* coarse; a caller wanting only links must take everything up to that level.
- **Option 5b:** feature flags (include `text`, `inline`, `sentences`, `tokens`,
  `annotations`, `layout` independently).
  - *Pros:* precise; minimal payloads.
  - *Cons:* more combinations to test/document.
- **Option 5c:** both: named levels as presets over the underlying flags.
  - *Pros:* easy default ladder and precise control when needed.
  - *Cons:* slight surface duplication.

**Leaning: composable `include` layers (the flags of 5c, without a named ladder).** Same
mechanism-over-menu reasoning as the rollup surface (E3). Settled in DR-5.

## E6. Computation and Caching

Carried from the tallies analysis and E2/E3: the node table derives from immutable
`source_text`.

- **Eager at parse:** rejected (pays even when unused; `blocks()` is opt-in).
- **Recompute each call:** simple but quadratic for per-section work.
- **Lazy-cached (leaning):** build the node table once on first structural access; views
  and rollups are cheap; `Section` work slices the cached tree instead of re-parsing.
  Safe because `source_text` is fixed; memoization is not a “stored count.”

## E7. Coordinates, IDs, Stability (from Research, Low-Controversy)

- **Coordinates:** canonical `source_span` in **Unicode code points** (matches Python
  `TextDoc`); optional derived `byte_span`/`utf16_span`/`line_column_span` for
  byte/browser consumers.
  Pin `offset_unit` in the schema.
- **Ids:** stable within a parse (`n_0001`…); the schema reserves an opaque `anchor`
  slot on annotation targets for a future CRDT/edit-edge id.
  Borrow the **red-green** idea (immutable node identity, position computed)
  conceptually; we do not need a full red-green implementation now.
- **Stability:** annotations (later) target node id **and** source span **and**
  text-quote, per W3C, so they survive a reparse.

## E8. Span References and Annotation Targeting (Dual Addressing)

One scheme must let a caller reference the document while **reading** (a source
line/span), while **editing in memory** (a parsed element, such as a table or a link,
possibly via a bridged editor model), while **saving** (source-grounded, since the
original document is what persists), and in **rendered output** (click a region →
element → source). The pivotal question is *what anchors a reference*, and which anchor
is canonical for persistence.

- **Option 8a:** source-span only.
  A reference is just a `source_span` (and maybe a quote).
  - *Pros:* trivially persistent and source-canonical; no per-parse identity to track;
    survives model rebuilds.
  - *Cons:* awkward to *create* against “the table node” or “this link” while editing
    the tree; brittle as a live handle under in-memory edits (offsets shift);
    rendered-UI selections must be span-mapped by hand.
- **Option 8b:** node-id only.
  A reference is a node `id` in the current model.
  - *Pros:* ergonomic in memory and in an editor bridge; O(1) lookup; natural for
    “annotate this table.”
  - *Cons:* node ids are **per-parse / per-session transient**, not stable across
    reparse or reopen, so they **cannot** be the persisted canonical; a saved id is
    meaningless to the next parse.
- **Option 8c:** multi-selector reference, source-canonical (recommended).
  A reference carries coordinated selectors: a transient `node_id` (in-memory handle),
  the canonical `source_span`, a `text_quote` (prefix/exact/suffix for robustness), an
  optional reparse-stable structural path, and a reserved opaque `anchor` (future
  CRDT/editor edge). Resolution is asymmetric and total in the useful direction:
  - **model → source is total:** every node has a `source_span`, so attaching at the
    model level (table/link) *automatically* yields a source-grounded reference.
    This is exactly the request: “attach at the document-model level … allows us to also
    attach at the grounded original level.”
  - **source → model is re-resolution:** after a (re)parse, find the node whose span
    matches/contains the reference; if the source moved, fall back to `text_quote` then
    the structural path.
    Robust, not guaranteed, which is why the *persisted* form keeps the source-grounded
    selectors, not the transient id.
  - *Pros:* one scheme for all four contexts; source stays canonical for save; tree
    stays ergonomic for edit; degrades gracefully after edits/reparses.
  - *Cons:* a small selector record to define and test; resolution rules to specify.

**Leaning: 8c.** It is the research’s W3C multi-selector targeting made concrete, plus
the explicit **save = source-grounded / edit = tree-handle** split the request calls
for.

Two consequences to design in:

- **Persistence rule.** On **save**, a reference is normalized to its source-grounded
  selectors (drop the transient `node_id`); the saved artifact is *original document and
  source-grounded annotations*. Future on-disk formats store annotations this way.
- **Editor-bridge round-trip.** When editing in memory (optionally bridged to a
  ProseMirror /block-JSON editor model), annotations attach to model nodes; on serialize
  they resolve to source spans and ride out through `DocGraph` to *original document and
  annotations that reference original-document structures*; on reopen, a reparse
  re-resolves them to nodes.
  Rendered HTML carries `data-node-id` / `data-source-span` so a UI selection maps back
  to a node and thence to source.

## E9. The Layered-Parsing Lens (Consolidating Frame, 2026-05-30)

After the background research (see
[`research-2026-05-30-multilayer-parsing.md`](../../research/research-2026-05-30-multilayer-parsing.md)),
one framing makes the whole design cohere and shows how to extend it cleanly: the
derived views are not ad-hoc; each is **one parse layer** over the shared offset space.
chopdiff already parses the same `source_text` along several independent dimensions:

| Layer | Produces | Depends on |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **textual** | paragraphs, sentences, word tokens | — |
| **markdown** | block elements (recursive) and inline (links, code, emphasis) | — |
| **document** | section / heading hierarchy and TOC | markdown (headings) |
| **synthetic** | regions marked by a small defined set of marker tags (today `<div>`/`<span>` via `TextNode`), chunk groupings | — |

This is **not a redesign**; it validates DR-1..DR-6 (a node table, not one tree, is
exactly what coexisting layers need) and reframes the settled views as layers.
The key realizations:

- **A reference is a layer, not a pointer.** The `SpanRef`-targeted annotation layer
  (E8/D5) is the out-of-band layer; it anchors to the same offset space as the parsed
  layers.
- **Cross-layer relationships are offset-containment queries, not stored edges.** Within
  a layer, `parent`/`children`; across layers, interval containment/overlap ("which
  blocks are inside this `<div>`", “which section contains this link”). This is what
  makes overlap representable and future cross-layer edits tractable.
- **Each layer declares a nesting guarantee:** well-nested → a tree view (`blocks()`,
  the section tree); ordered-only → a sequential list view (`base_blocks()`, a flat
  annotation layer). This generalizes the §6 tree-vs-partition distinction to every
  layer.
- **Enablement is a configuration, not a fork.** Today’s
  `TextNode`-as-separable-subsystem is simply “the synthetic layer enabled alone.”
  The same model serves the cheap structural-only path and the full multi-layer analysis
  path; we never maintain two architectures.

**Four cheap “design-in-now” hooks** make the synthetic layer and future structural
edits a small lift later instead of a refactor; they are the entire delta this lens
adds:

1. **A `layer` field on `Node`**
   (`Node{id, kind, layer, parent, children, source_span, attrs}`). Almost free in Phase
   1; it is what lets the synthetic layer’s nodes coexist by span rather than by fitting
   one tree.
2. **Offset-containment as a `collect()` mode:** interval containment/overlap so
   cross-layer queries work without re-parsing.
3. **A per-layer nesting guarantee** (tree vs ordered list), recorded on each layer.
4. **`SpanRef` as the anchor for edits too,** not just annotations, so the later
   structural operations attach to `SpanRef`s and survive reparse.

**Unified `Layer` vocabulary (settled 2026-05-30).** “Layer” now means a **parse
dimension** you can *enable* (build) and *include* (serialize): `textual`, `markdown`,
`document`, `synthetic`, and later `annotations`/`layout`. The earlier DR-5 enum members
(`text`, `inline`, `tokens`, derived coords) become **detail sub-options** of a layer
(payload richness), not top-level layers; one vocabulary instead of two.
Enabling `document` auto-enables `markdown` (its only dependency).
This refines DR-5’s *membership*, not its mechanism (composable, no fixed ladder); see
DR-5.

**Later by design, not now.** The **synthetic layer** (structure from a small defined
set of marker tags, re-expressing `TextNode`’s tag parsing as a layer keyed into the
node table) and **cross-layer structural-edit operations** (move/wrap/splice anchored on
`SpanRef`, generalizing today’s `div_insert_wrapped`) are named later phases (Phases
3–4). The four hooks above ensure they drop in without reworking the core, which is the
whole point of getting the layered shape right now.

# Proposed Design

This is the recommended synthesis (1b + 2a + 3c + 4a + 5c and lazy cache), to be
confirmed under “Decisions.”

## D1. The `DocGraph` Schema

A single JSON object, boring and parser-agnostic (no Marko/Python class names in stable
fields; those go in `metadata`). Shape (abbreviated; see the research JSON sketch):

```
DocGraph = {
  schema: "DocGraph/v0.1",
  source:  { format, offset_unit: "unicode_code_points", sha256, text? },
  nodes:   [ Node, ... ],            # the stable node set (block + inline families)
  views:   { toc, blocks, links, sentences, ... },   # arrays of node ids (projections)
  annotations: [],  layout: [],  provenance: []      # reserved typed layers (later)
}

Node = {
  id, kind, layer, role?, parent?, children: [id...],   # `layer` = parse dimension (E9)
  source_span: {start,end}?,         # code points; None for unlocatable inline (ref links)
  byte_span?, utf16_span?,           # optional derived coords
  attrs: { ... },                    # e.g. heading level, list ordered/tight, link url/title
  text?,                             # included only at TEXT/FULL detail
  metadata?: { ... }                 # parser specifics live here, never in stable fields
}
```

- The **containment tree** is `nodes` via `parent`/`children` from the `document` root:
  this is the “exact original structure” tree.
- The **section tree** is the `toc` view (heading nodes and nesting), an overlay since
  it cross-cuts block containment.
- **Inline items** are nodes whose `parent` is their block; `links` view indexes them.
- Every view is an array of ids → O(n) derivable, sharing identity.

## D2. Python Projection and Query API (over `TextDoc`)

A builder turns a `TextDoc` (and its cached recursive block tree, sections, links) into
the node table, lazily and cached on the immutable source.
Public surface (additive), kept deliberately minimal: **one general query primitive, no
blessed per-kind rollups** (DR-4).

- `TextDoc.graph(*, include=...) -> DocGraph`: build/serialize; `include` is a set of
  optional layers, default = structural core only (DR-5).
- **One query primitive**, at document / section / block scope:
  ```python
  collect(*, kinds=None, where=None, recursive=False, inline=None) -> list[Node]
  ```
  `kinds=` selects by node kind (typed, common case); `where=` is a `Node -> bool`
  predicate escape hatch for anything else; `recursive` descends into children and
  includes inline descendants by default; `inline=False` excludes them explicitly.
  It returns **nodes**, each carrying `span`, `attrs`, and edges.
- **Values, counts, and groupings are standard Python over the result**, documented with
  clear examples, not separate methods:
  ```python
  dg.collect(kinds={NodeKind.table}, recursive=True)            # the tables (values + spans)
  len(dg.collect(kinds={NodeKind.table}, recursive=True))       # how many
  Counter(n.kind for n in dg.collect(recursive=True))           # tally by kind
  {k: list(g) for k, g in groupby(... )}                        # group as needed
  ```
- Scope handles: `dg` (document), `dg.section(id)`, `dg.node(id)`; each exposes
  `collect`, so rollups are uniform across scopes.
- Relationships are node edges, not a separate rollup: `node.parent`, `node.ancestors`,
  `node.section`, `node.sentence` (for inline).
  “links in section 3” =
  `dg.section(s3).collect(kinds={NodeKind.link}, recursive=True)`; pair with their block
  via `[(n, n.parent) for n in ...]`.

This makes the structural block tree fully recursive (containers populate children),
fixing the tallies gap: a table inside a blockquote or list item is a node and is found.
The existing v0.3.1 convenience accessors (`TextDoc.block_type_counts()`,
`Section.block_type_counts()`) are **superseded by `collect()`** and are removed when
the unified model lands (migration: `Counter(n.kind for n in dg.collect(...))`); this is
a semi-breaking change for the next minor.

## D3. Detail / Payload Control

`graph(*, include=..., detail=...)` controls what is built and serialized.
**`include` is a set of `Layer`s**, the parse dimensions: `textual`, `markdown`,
`document`, `synthetic`, later `annotations`/`layout` (E9). The structural core (node
table: ids, kinds, `layer`, parent/children, `source_span`) is always present; each
enabled layer adds its nodes/views.
There is **no fixed level ladder** (DR-5); a caller composes exactly the layers they
need; enabling `document` auto-enables its dependency `markdown`:

```python
graph()                                       # default layers, structural core (small)
graph(include={Layer.markdown, Layer.document})           # blocks + sections
graph(include={Layer.markdown}, detail={Detail.text, Detail.inline})  # + node text + inline
```

**Payload richness within a layer is a small set of `detail` sub-options** (`text`,
`inline`, `tokens`, derived coords), the former DR-5 enum members, now detail flags
rather than top-level layers (E9 unified vocabulary).
Each layer/detail maps to a cleanly separable part of the Pydantic model.
Common compositions are shown in docs as *examples*, not blessed presets; a downstream
user who wants a preset defines their own `frozenset`. New parse dimensions are one more
`Layer`; new payload categories are one more `detail`, additive, no refactor.

## D4. How the Requirements Are Met

| Requirement | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Rollups of values or counts, any time | one `collect()` over the node set; counts via `len`/`Counter` |
| Around blocks or whole document, by section | scope handles: document / `section(id)` / `node(id)` |
| Recursively collect blocks, inline, and relationships | `collect(recursive=True)`; parent/section/sentence edges |
| Full recursive structure | fully-populated containment tree in `nodes` |
| Tree → exact structure or any rollup | containment tree view and rollup projections of one node set |
| Single serializable JSON for UIs | `DocGraph` schema, id-addressed, parser-agnostic |
| Optional levels of detail | composable `include` layers (no fixed ladder); default = core |
| Reference anything (source / element / rendered) | one `SpanRef` with coordinated selectors (D5) |
| Persist source-grounded; edit by tree | save normalizes to source selectors; in-memory uses `node_id` |

## D5. Span References (`SpanRef`), Annotations, and Persistence

A single small **`SpanRef`** type underlies all addressing (E8, 8c). Its design follows
the prior art surveyed in
[`research-2026-05-30-span-references.md`](../../research/research-2026-05-30-span-references.md)
(Chrome URL Text Fragments, W3C Web Annotation selectors, Hypothesis fuzzy anchoring,
RFC 5147); see that brief for syntaxes, links, and full trade-offs.

```
SpanRef = {
  # Quoted span — CANONICAL, durable anchor (survives edits; Chrome-Text-Fragment shaped)
  exact: str,
  prefix?: str,        # ~32-128 chars of enclosing context, for uniqueness
  suffix?: str,
  # Syntactic span — exact within the current source; a recomputable HINT (code points)
  start?: int,
  end?: int,
  # node_id: in-memory handle only, NEVER persisted
}
Annotation = { id, kind, target: SpanRef, body, metadata? }
```

**Canonical = the quote; offset = a hint.** This is the key lesson from the research:
every mature system (W3C `oa:Choice`, Hypothesis) treats the **text quote
(`exact`+`prefix`/ `suffix`) as the durable anchor** and **character offsets as
accelerators**, because the quote survives restructuring and is fuzzy-matchable while
offsets shift on any earlier edit.
Within one parse the offset is exact (chopdiff retains `source_text`), so it is the fast
path; across edits the quote is what recovers the target.

### Syntactic (offset) vs quoted (prefix/suffix) matching: trade-offs

|  | Syntactic offset span (`start`/`end`) | Quoted span (`exact`+`prefix`/`suffix`) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Robust to edits elsewhere | ✘ shifts | ✅ survives |
| Disambiguation of repeats | ✅ exact position | ✅ via prefix/suffix (✘ exact-only) |
| Cost / compactness | ✅ two ints | proportional to quote and context |
| Browser/Text-Fragment shaped | ✘ (no offsets in `#:~:text=`) | ✅ maps directly |
| Sub-word / code targets | ✅ | ✘ (Text Fragments are word-boundary, case-insensitive) |

So we keep **both**: offsets for exact, cheap, in-parse addressing; the quote for
durable, portable, edit-surviving references.
(Compare RFC 5147 `#char=`/`#line=` with `;md5=` integrity, which provides offset and
change-detection but no recovery, vs the quote’s fuzzy recovery.)

### Rules

- **model → source is total.** Building a `SpanRef` from any node fills both the offset
  (the node’s `source_span`) and the quote (sliced from source and context), so
  attaching at the model level (table, link) is automatically grounded in the original
  source.
- **source → model is re-resolution.** Fast path: if the text at `start:end` still
  equals `exact`, accept.
  Else fuzzy re-anchor via `exact`+`prefix`/`suffix` (offset as a search hint, then full
  document), and update `start`/`end`. (Mirrors Hypothesis’ strategy.)
- **Persistence is quote-canonical and source-grounded.** Saving keeps the quote
  (durable) and drops the transient `node_id`; offsets persist only as hints.
  The saved artifact is the **original document plus source-grounded annotations**.
- **Chrome Text Fragment** export is a lossy projection of the quote
  (`#:~:text=[prefix-,]exact[,-suffix]`): prose only, word-boundary, case-insensitive;
  truncate context for URL length.
  The directive is generated on demand, never stored.
- **Rendered output references back.** HTML/render helpers emit `data-node-id` and
  `data-source-span` so a click/selection resolves to a node and thence to source.
- **Offset unit is Unicode code points** (Python-native); provide a UTF-16 conversion
  for JS interop (the W3C position-selector unit ambiguity is a known cross-language
  footgun).
- **Deferred (not in v1):** an XPath/DOM `structural_path` (environment-specific) and an
  opaque CRDT `anchor` slot, added only if a concrete need appears.

Annotations are a **stand-off layer** (the research’s conceptual core): parsed structure
(sections, blocks, links) and added structure (summaries, notes, rewrite suggestions)
are the same kind of thing: typed layers of `SpanRef`-targeted records.
**Building the annotation layer is a later phase**, and we expect to **revisit and
refine it** (and possibly `SpanRef` itself) once v1 is in use; this plan only fixes the
`SpanRef` contract and resolution rules now so the node model, schema, and editor bridge
are designed around it.
v1 is at least as expressive as a Chrome-style `exact`+`prefix`/`suffix` selector, which
is the agreed floor.

Worked use case (read → edit → save): open a Markdown doc; build the in-memory model
(optionally bridged to an editor); a user/AI annotates the parsed table and a link
(model nodes); on save, the `SpanRef`s persist quote-canonical and serialize as
*original Markdown and source-grounded annotations*; reopening reparses and re-resolves
them to nodes (fast path when unchanged, fuzzy re-anchor when edited).

## Decisions (All Settled)

Summary index; rationale and consequences are in the Decision Record below.

1. **Node set vs single tree (E1).** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29): node-table-with-views
   (1b).** A stable node table (id and span) is canonical; the containment tree, section
   tree, block list, and inline index are derived views, and the JSON presents a
   `document` root with children as its top-level shape.
   Container children are fully populated (a table inside a blockquote/list item is a
   node), with top-level `blocks()` shape preserved and a `recursive` opt-in for
   traversal/rollups. See the Decision Record and the archived
   [tallies note](../archive/plan-2026-05-29-multilevel-block-tallies.md) axis A.
2. **Projection vs runtime object (E2).** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29): projection (2a).**
   `DocGraph` is a derived projection/contract built from `TextDoc` (the Python core),
   not a competing editable runtime model.
   It may be a rich value with query methods, but source text / `TextDoc` stays
   canonical; edits go through `TextDoc`/source and re-derive.
   See the Decision Record.
3. **Rollup surface (E3/E4).** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29): Option B, one general query
   primitive, no blessed shortcuts.** A single
   `collect(*, kinds=, where=, recursive=, inline=)` over the node set, at
   doc/section/block scope; counts/values/groupings are standard Python
   (`len`/`Counter`/comprehensions) documented with clear examples.
   Inline items are nodes (4a); relationships are node edges.
   No per-kind rollup methods, to keep the embeddable library’s surface small.
   See DR-4.
4. **Detail axis (E5).** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29; vocabulary unified 2026-05-30): Option
   B, composable layers, no fixed ladder.** `include` selects which `Layer`s (parse
   dimensions: `textual`/`markdown`/`document`/`synthetic`/…) to build and serialize;
   `detail` sub-options (`text`/`inline`/`tokens`/coords) control payload richness.
   Default = structural core; presets are caller-defined, not blessed.
   Same simplicity-and-flexibility principle as DR-4. See DR-5 and E9.
5. **Schema versioning home.** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29): Pydantic as the authoring
   layer.** The `DocGraph` schema is authored as Pydantic models (single source of
   truth), which emit a JSON Schema; a standalone language-neutral artifact (JSON
   Schema, or a TypeScript/Zod mirror) is formalized later once the shape stabilizes.
   See DR-3.
6. **Scope of phase 1.** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29): minimal slice.** Phase 1 is the
   recursive node model, `collect()`, and `SpanRef` contract; annotations, operations,
   provenance, and layout are schema-reserved and built in later phases.
7. **Span-reference selector set (`SpanRef`) (E8/D5).** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-30):
   `SpanRef` carries a quoted span (`exact`+`prefix`/`suffix`, the canonical durable
   anchor) and an offset span (`start`/`end`, code points, a recomputable hint);
   quote-canonical persistence; Chrome-Text-Fragment convertible; `node_id` never
   persisted; `structural_path` and CRDT `anchor` deferred.** Informed by
   [`research-2026-05-30-span-references.md`](../../research/research-2026-05-30-span-references.md).
   See DR-6.
8. **Computation/caching (E6).** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29): lazy-cache** the node table
   off the immutable `source_text` (also fixes the quadratic per-section
   `Section.blocks()` re-parse).
   Memoization of a derived view is not a “stored count”; the contract is “do not
   reassign `source_text` after parse.”
   Already de-risked by the robustness Phase-1 `sub_doc`/`sub_paras` copy fix.
9. **List-item paragraph counting.** ✅ **SETTLED (2026-05-29): count it.** The wrapper
   `Paragraph` inside each list item is counted as a `paragraph`; it is
   density-invariant (tight and loose items both wrap), and excluding it would be a
   special case.

## Decision Record

### DR-1: Canonical structure: node table with derived views (settles Open decision 1)

**Decision (2026-05-29):** Store the document structure as a **stable node table**
(`Node{id, kind, parent, children, source_span, attrs}`) covering blocks, inline items,
and headings.
The block containment tree, section tree, block list, link index, and token
stream are **derived views** (arrays of node ids / filters), not the canonical store.
The serialized JSON presents a `document` root with `children` as its top-level shape,
so the tree remains a first-class view.

**Why:** chopdiff has several hierarchies that overlap and do not nest.
A section spans sibling blocks and is not a subtree of the block tree; links are inline
ranges; annotations target arbitrary spans.
A single canonical tree privileges one hierarchy and forces every other structure to be
a bespoke overlay with its own addressing.
A node table gives one id space for blocks *and* inline items, makes overlapping layers
and “zoom = pick a view and level” cheap O(n) projections, and serializes to the flat,
id-addressed JSON frontends want.
(A single tree would have sufficed for analysis-only counts/slices, but not for
annotations, the dual source/tree `SpanRef` model, or UI serialization.)

**Consequences:** a node-table builder to write and test; discipline on id stability and
span units (Unicode code points, decision 7/E7); container children become populated
(additive to `Block.children`, noted in the changelog).
Over-modeling is bounded by the minimal Phase-1 scope (decision 6).

### DR-2: `DocGraph` is a projection of `TextDoc`, not a runtime model (settles Open decision 2)

**Decision (2026-05-29):** `DocGraph` is a **derived projection / serialized contract**
built from `TextDoc` (the Python core).
It may be returned as a rich value with a `collect()` query method, but it is
**read-mostly and not canonical**: source text / `TextDoc` is the source of truth, and
edits go through `TextDoc`/source and re-derive.
No competing editable runtime document model.

**Why:** keeping source canonical avoids the central failure mode: a rich in-memory
model drifting away from the actual Markdown (the ProseMirror/CRDT trap, where Markdown
becomes secondary). It minimizes new public surface, reuses `TextDoc`’s
spans/sections/links/size machinery, and keeps `DocGraph` honest as a cross-language
contract (Python and a future TS client are both implementations of one schema).
A first-class runtime object is reserved for the day a genuine runtime boundary (e.g.
live collaborative editing) requires it.

**Consequences:** query/rollup methods live on the small derived object `graph()`
returns (not bloating `TextDoc`); the projection is lazily cached off the immutable
`source_text` (decision 8), so the operative contract is “do not reassign `source_text`
after parse.” Editing is “edit `TextDoc`/source, then re-derive,” with the editor edge
bridging through the `SpanRef` model (E8/D5).

### DR-3: Schema authoring layer: Pydantic now, formal schema later (settles Open decision 5)

**Decision (2026-05-29):** Author the `DocGraph` schema as **Pydantic models**, the
single source of truth in Python, which also emit a JSON Schema.
A standalone language-neutral artifact (formal JSON Schema, or a TypeScript/Zod mirror
for clients) is derived and frozen later, once the shape stabilizes against real use
cases.

**Why:** fastest to build and validate against `TextDoc`; Pydantic gives validation plus
JSON-Schema export for free; avoids prematurely freezing a hand-written schema before
use cases prove the shape.
The model ≠ format separation (research) holds: the Pydantic models *are* the authored
contract; JSON Schema and Zod are projections of it.

**Consequences:** keep parser-internal fields out of the stable models (in `metadata`);
pin `offset_unit` (Unicode code points); when the shape stabilizes, publish the emitted
JSON Schema as the cross-language artifact and consider a Zod mirror for TS clients.

### DR-4: Rollup surface: one general query primitive, no blessed shortcuts (settles Open decision 3)

**Decision (2026-05-29):** Provide a **single general query primitive**,
`collect(*, kinds=, where=, recursive=, inline=)`, over the node set at
doc/section/block scope, and **no per-kind rollup methods**. Values are the returned
nodes; counts and groupings are standard Python (`len`, `Counter`, comprehensions),
documented with clear worked examples.
Relationships are node edges (`parent`/`section`/`sentence`), not a separate API.

**Why:** chopdiff is a low-level library embedded in other programs.
A fixed menu of “blessed” rollups (`tables()`, `code_blocks()`, …) is combinatorial
(kind × scope × recursive × values/counts × inline), can’t cover ad-hoc queries, and
grows the surface to design, version, and maintain.
One primitive with a `kinds=` selector plus a `where=` predicate escape hatch is
maximally flexible, has a tiny stable surface, and keeps “no stored counts” by
construction.
The maintenance cost of shortcuts of uncertain value is not worth embedding
in a low-level dependency.

**Consequences:** discoverability rests on clear docs and worked examples (the
`examples/normalized_form.py` pattern) rather than autocomplete; the v0.3.1
`block_type_counts()` accessors are superseded by `collect()` and removed in the next
minor (migration documented).
Add named conveniences later only if docs/usage prove a specific one is broadly needed.

### DR-5: Detail/payload control: composable `include` layers, no fixed ladder (settles Open decision 4)

**Decision (2026-05-29; vocabulary unified 2026-05-30, E9):** Control what is built and
serialized with two composable axes: **`include` = a set of `Layer`s** (parse
dimensions: `textual`, `markdown`, `document`, `synthetic`, later
`annotations`/`layout`) and **`detail` = payload sub-options** (`text`, `inline`,
`tokens`, derived coords).
The structural core (node table, `layer`, and spans) is always present; everything else
is opt-in. **No fixed `OUTLINE/BLOCKS/INLINE/FULL` ladder.** Presets are caller-defined
`frozenset`, documented as examples, not blessed constants.
(Originally the `Layer` enum mixed parse dimensions and payload detail; E9 split them
into `Layer` and `detail` for one consistent vocabulary, a membership refinement, not a
mechanism change.)

**Why:** same simplicity-and-flexibility principle as DR-4, applied to the payload axis.
A fixed cumulative ladder is coarse (can’t ask for “blocks and links but no text”) and a
new downstream combination forces inserting a level, a breaking, refactor-inducing
change. Orthogonal flags give any combination with a small, stable surface; new data
categories are one additive `Layer`. This is a document model meant to serve many
situations without being updated each time.

**Consequences:** keep the default small and useful (core only); each `Layer` maps to a
cleanly separable part of the Pydantic models so “include or not” is a clean per-layer
toggle; testing is linear (per layer), not combinatorial; document common compositions
as examples.

### DR-6: Span references: `SpanRef` (quote canonical and offset hint) (settles Open decision 7)

**Decision (2026-05-30):** A small **`SpanRef`** type carries two coordinated span
kinds: a **quoted span** (`exact` and optional `prefix`/`suffix`) that is the
**canonical durable anchor**, and an **offset span** (`start`/`end` in Unicode code
points) that is a **recomputable hint**. Persistence is quote-canonical and
source-grounded; `node_id` is an in-memory handle only and is never persisted.
The quote is shaped to be **convertible to/from a Chrome URL Text Fragment** (lossy:
prose, word-boundary, case-insensitive).
A reparse-stable `structural_path` and a CRDT `anchor` slot are **deferred** until a
concrete need appears.
Full shape, rules, and the syntactic-vs-quoted trade-off table are in D5.

**Why:** the surveyed prior art (see
[`research-2026-05-30-span-references.md`](../../research/research-2026-05-30-span-references.md):
Chrome Text Fragments, W3C Web Annotation `TextQuoteSelector`/`TextPositionSelector` and
`oa:Choice`, Hypothesis fuzzy anchoring, RFC 5147) converges on storing the **text quote
as the durable anchor with positions as accelerators**: quotes survive edits and
re-anchor fuzzily; offsets shift.
Carrying both gives exact cheap in-parse addressing *and* edit-surviving,
browser-portable references, with one source-canonical form.

**Consequences:** Phase 1 ships the `SpanRef` contract and exact (fast-path) resolution;
the fuzzy re-anchor and the Chrome Text Fragment export are wired behind it (fuzzy path
may be stubbed first).
The **annotation layer is a later phase and is expected to be revisited and refined**
once v1 is in use; `SpanRef` v1 is deliberately scoped to the Chrome-style
`exact`+`prefix`/`suffix` floor, accepting later enhancement.

## Implementation Plan

All decisions are settled, so we **update the design of record first** (Phase 0) and
then implement against it, keeping `docs/flexdoc-spec.md` the single current,
comprehensive, concise design doc for the document model.

### Phase 0: make `docs/flexdoc-spec.md` current (do first)

Fold the settled DocGraph design into the design of record before writing code, so the
implementation is built against current docs.
The DocGraph/`collect`/`SpanRef` edits are applied; the E9 layer-concept edits are the
remaining Phase-0 work (see “Design-of-record updates” below for the per-section
detail):

- [x] §3 normalized form: canonical normalized form is the **node table**; `TextDoc` is
  the Python core/editing view, `DocGraph` the derived projection/contract (DR-1, DR-2).
- [x] §6 structural tree: containers fully populate children (recursive); the block tree
  is a derived view; density-invariant.
- [x] §8 inline: inline items are nodes; links via `collect(kinds={link})`.
- [x] §9 derived views: the single `collect()` primitive (DR-4) replaces
  `block_type_counts()`; composable `include` layers (DR-5); drop “top-level only”.
- [x] New section: **DocGraph** node model and JSON schema (Pydantic authoring, views,
  layers, coordinates = Unicode code points), and **`SpanRef`** and the (later)
  annotation stand-off layer (DR-3, DR-6).
- [x] §11 invariants: node-id stability within a parse; quote-canonical references; no
  blessed rollups/levels.
  §12: add the span-references research brief.
- [x] **E9 layer concept:** §3/§4 introduce the four parse **layers** and the `layer`
  field on `Node` and the dependency DAG; cross-layer relationships are
  **offset-containment** queries; each layer has a **nesting guarantee** (tree vs
  ordered list). §10 unify the `Layer` vocabulary (parse dimensions) and `detail`
  sub-options. §13 note the synthetic layer / cross-layer edits are later phases (not
  “replace `TextNode`”). §15 add the multilayer brief.

### Phase 1: recursive node model and flexible rollups (Python)

- [x] Make the structural block tree fully recursive (containers populate block
  children); keep top-level `blocks()` shape, add deep traversal.
  Density-invariant preserved.
- [x] Add `base_blocks(*, item_partition_depth=6)`: the flat, depth-annotated
  **sequential block list** (partition).
  `item_partition_depth` controls list decomposition (default 6; `-1` unlimited; `0`
  lists unsplit); blockquotes always atomic.
  Invariant: ordered, non-overlapping, complete cover whose reassembly reproduces the
  document (exact except normalized paragraph-break whitespace; exact via offsets).
  A base block is a block node; the base-block *list* is the partition.
  (flexdoc-spec §6.)
- [x] Model inline items as nodes with `parent` block and computed `section`/`sentence`.
- [x] **Tag every node with its `layer`** (textual / markdown / document) and record
  each layer’s **nesting guarantee** (tree vs ordered list).
  Reserve the `synthetic` layer (not built in Phase 1). (E9 hooks 1 and 3; cheap now,
  enables Phases 3–4.)
- [x] Lazy-cache the node table on the immutable `source_text`; make `Section.blocks()`
  slice the cached tree (remove per-section reparse).
- [x] Add the single `collect(*, kinds=, where=, recursive=, inline=)` query primitive
  with document / section / block scope handles, **including an offset-containment mode
  for cross-layer queries** (E9 hook 2). No per-kind rollup methods (DR-4).
- [x] Define the `SpanRef` type and resolution: `SpanRef.from_node(node)` (total
  model→source), `span_ref.resolve(source_text)` (source→model: exact fast path, then
  quote re-anchor), and `to_persisted()` (drop transient offsets by default).
  `SpanRef` is the anchor for edits too, not just annotations (E9 hook 4). No annotation
  *storage* yet; just the targeting contract the rest of the model is designed around.
- [x] Tests: nested tables/code in blockquotes and list items are counted and locatable;
  per-section value and count rollups; density invariance; section slicing; `SpanRef`
  round-trips (node → source-grounded → re-resolved node) and survives a reparse.

### Phase 2: `DocGraph` serialization and detail levels

- [x] Pydantic/dataclass models for the schema (nodes, views, source, reserved
  `annotations` layer with the `SpanRef` target shape); `offset_unit` pinned to Unicode
  code points; optional derived coords.
- [x] `TextDoc.graph(*, include=…)` builder and `Layer` set (no ladder); render helpers
  emit `data-node-id` / `data-source-span` so rendered selections resolve back to
  source.
- [x] Round-trip and golden tests; a tiny UI fixture is out of scope here (later phase).
- [x] Author the standalone language-neutral JSON Schema once the shape is confirmed
  (decision 5).

### Phase 3 (later): the synthetic layer

Re-express the existing `<div>`/`<span>` structural parsing (`TextNode`, `parse_divs`,
chunking) as the **synthetic layer** keyed into the shared node table, reconciling the
two structural models the codebase has today (marko block model vs the `TextNode` tag
parser). Deferred by design (E9), and specifically until **after the FlexDoc package
separation**: its only source (`divs`/`TextNode`) lives in chopdiff and migrates into
the flexdoc repo at the extraction plan’s Stage 4
([`plan-2026-06-11-flexdoc-extraction.md`](plan-2026-06-11-flexdoc-extraction.md)), so
building it earlier would re-couple the packages.
It is not needed to ship the core, and the Phase-1 hooks (`layer` field,
offset-containment `collect()`) make it additive rather than a rewrite when it does
land.

The **synthetic layer is the general “structure from marker tags” mechanism**, not just
`<div>`/`<span>`. “Synthetic” means structure that is not inherent in the prose or
Markdown but is added via a small, defined whitelist of marker tags, which can be
different kinds of tags: standard HTML containers (`<div>`/`<span>`, today), custom
semantic tags (`<chunk>`), or comment-delimited Markdoc-style directives
(`<!-- chunk id="foo" -->`). This is the design principle; the initial implementation
need only cover today’s `<div>`/`<span>`.

- [ ] Map `parse_divs`/`TextNode` output into `Node`s tagged `layer=synthetic`, keeping
  exact offsets; the existing parser can back it (no new dependency).
  Carry the tag name and attributes in `attrs` so a new marker tag is a whitelist entry,
  not a new code path.
- [ ] Synthetic nodes coexist with markdown/textual nodes by span; cross-layer queries
  ("which markdown blocks are inside this `<div class="chunk">`") via
  offset-containment.
- [ ] In-band metadata (`<span data-timestamp>`, or a `<!-- ... -->` directive) becomes
  a synthetic-layer node that can emit a `SpanRef` for free, unifying in-band and
  out-of-band (annotation-layer) metadata.

### Phase 4 (later): cross-layer structural edits and stand-off layers

The eventual payoff: **structural-edit operations anchored on `SpanRef` that work
uniformly across layers**, generalizing today’s synthetic-structure edits
(`div_insert_wrapped`, wrap/splice).
Plus the built-out `annotations` (stand-off), `operation`/`provenance`, and `layout`
layers the schema reserves.
Like Phase 3, this is **deferred to after the FlexDoc separation** and lands in the
flexdoc repo (it builds on the synthetic layer and the `SpanRef` contract).

- [ ] Operation records (move section, wrap region, replace block, splice) that resolve
  targets via `SpanRef`, apply to source, re-derive, and validate (reparse and token
  diff).
- [ ] The `annotations` stand-off layer (built on the Phase-1 `SpanRef` contract);
  revisit and refine `SpanRef`/annotations once v1 is in use, as DR-6 anticipates.
- [ ] `provenance` (source-map-style generated↔original) and `layout` overlays as
  needed.

## Design-of-Record Updates (`docs/flexdoc-spec.md`)

Phase 0 makes `docs/flexdoc-spec.md` the single current, comprehensive, concise design
doc. Per-section edits (the design doc carries the prose; this maps what changes):

- **§1 Purpose / §2 Goals:** add that the serialized normalized-form contract is
  `DocGraph` (language-neutral, frontend-serializable); `TextDoc` is the Python core.
  Goals add: cross-language JSON contract, source-canonical references, simplicity and
  flexibility (one query primitive, composable layers, no blessed menus).
- **§3 The normalized form:** the **node table is canonical**; the block tree, section
  tree, inline index, and token stream are derived views; `DocGraph` is the projection
  of `TextDoc` (DR-1, DR-2). **Introduce the four parse layers** (textual / markdown /
  document / synthetic): the views *are* layer views, with the dependency DAG (document
  → markdown) and **offset-containment as the cross-layer relationship** (E9).
- **§4 Core types and offsets:** define
  `Node{id, kind, layer, parent, children, source_span, attrs}` (the `layer` field, E9);
  node ids stable within a parse; each layer carries a **nesting guarantee** (tree vs
  ordered list); **pin the offset unit to Unicode code points** with byte/UTF-16
  conversions as derived coords.
- **§5 Block-type model:** note containers (blockquote, list item) fully populate block
  children; `ordered_list` already present.
- **§6 Block views:** terminology (*block element*/*inline* vs *block node* vs *base
  block*); the recursive structural tree (containers fully populate children;
  density-invariant) **and** the flat `base_blocks()` sequential partition (ordered,
  non-overlapping, complete cover; depth-annotated; reassembly reproduces the document);
  the query-vs-partition distinction.
- **§7 Sections and TOC:** section is a view; `Section`-scoped `collect()` for
  per-section slices/rollups.
- **§8 Inline elements and links:** inline items are first-class nodes; links are
  `collect(kinds={link})`; block↔inline relationships are node edges.
- **§9 Derived views and rollups:** replace the “top-level only / planned” status with
  the settled single `collect(*, kinds=, where=, recursive=, inline=)` primitive (DR-4);
  counts/values via standard Python; **remove `block_type_counts()`** (superseded;
  migration note); payload via composable `include` layers (DR-5).
- **New section, DocGraph schema:** node table, views, and reserved layers; Pydantic
  authoring (DR-3); **unified `Layer` vocabulary** (parse dimensions) and `detail`
  sub-options (E9); coordinates.
- **§13 invariants/non-goals:** refine “replacing `TextNode`” non-goal: `TextNode`
  stays; **expressing it as the synthetic layer (Phase 3) and cross-layer structural
  edits (Phase 4) are later phases**, not non-goals.
  Cross-layer relations are offset-containment, never stored cross-layer edges.
- **New section, `SpanRef` and annotations:** the span-reference type (quote canonical
  and offset hint; Chrome-Text-Fragment convertible; DR-6); the stand-off annotation
  layer as a later phase expected to be refined.
- **§10 Editing and serialization:** `DocGraph` serialization with `include` layers;
  edit `TextDoc`/source then re-derive; rendered `data-node-id`/`data-source-span`.
- **§11 Invariants and non-goals:** node-id stability within a parse; quote-canonical
  references; no blessed rollups/levels; offset unit pinned.
  Non-goals: no parallel runtime model, no DOM/XPath selectors,
  annotations/operations/provenance/layout are later.
- **§12 References:** add `research-2026-05-30-span-references.md`,
  `research-2026-05-30-multilayer-parsing.md`, the document-model survey, and this plan.

When Phase 0 lands, the `block_type_counts()` removal is the one semi-breaking changelog
item (migration: `Counter(n.kind for n in doc.graph().collect(...))`).

## Testing Strategy

- Recursive tallies: a document with tables/code nested in blockquotes and list items
  yields correct counts *and* locations at document, section, and block scope.
- Density invariance: tight vs loose lists give identical structural rollups.
- Section slicing: every view/rollup scoped to a section matches a whole-document filter
  restricted to that section’s span; spans stay within `section.span`.
- Serialization: `DocGraph` round-trips; ids are stable within a parse; stable fields
  contain no parser-internal names; `include` layers compose (including a layer adds
  only its part; the structural core is always present).
- Coordinates: `source_span` round-trips against `source_text`; derived byte/UTF-16
  spans agree on ASCII and a multi-byte sample.
- Span references: a `SpanRef` built from a node carries the node’s `source_span`;
  persisting drops `node_id`; after a no-op reparse it re-resolves to the same node;
  after an edit that shifts offsets, `text_quote` still re-resolves it.
  An annotation created against a parsed table/link serializes with a source-grounded
  target.

## Relationship to Other Specs

- **Subsumes** the archived
  [`plan-2026-05-29-multilevel-block-tallies.md`](../archive/plan-2026-05-29-multilevel-block-tallies.md)
  (multi-level tallies = the rollup feature of phase 1; kept in `archive/` for its
  detailed nested-block/caching axis analysis).
- **Updates `docs/flexdoc-spec.md`** (the design of record) **first**, in Phase 0; see
  “Design-of-record updates,” so implementation is built against current docs.
- Independent of `plan-2026-05-26-robustness-hardening.md`.
