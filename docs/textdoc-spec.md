# TextDoc and DocGraph: Design Specification

**Status:** Definitive front-to-back design of the document model (the `flexdoc`
package): the `TextDoc` Python core and the `DocGraph` serialized projection.
The design is settled (decision records DR-1..DR-6 in
[`plan-2026-05-29-unified-document-model.md`](project/specs/active/plan-2026-05-29-unified-document-model.md));
see §14 for what is implemented versus in progress.
Dated plans under `docs/project/specs/` describe the incremental work toward this
design.

## 1. Purpose

The document model consolidates, in one source-anchored structure, what a document
analysis or editing task normally needs from separate tools, and anchors every piece
back to the source by exact character offset:

- **Markdown block structure:** headings, paragraphs, lists/list items, tables, code,
  blockquotes, HTML, footnotes, thematic breaks.
- **Markdown inline structure:** links, code spans, inline HTML.
- **Language structure:** paragraphs, sentences, words/wordtoks, and the spacing between
  them.
- **Document structure:** heading hierarchy and TOC.

A Markdown parser gives you a block/inline AST but no sentences, sizes, or section
rollups. An NLP toolkit gives sentences but no Markdown structure and no exact source
mapping. This model is both, anchored to one retained source string.

Two surfaces, one design:

- **`TextDoc`** is the **Python core:** the in-process object for parsing, analysis,
  rollups, transforms, and editable reassembly.
- **`DocGraph`** is the **serialized, language-neutral projection** of the same content:
  a JSON contract for frontends, cross-language clients, and annotations.
  It is derived from `TextDoc`, not a competing model (DR-2).

## 2. Principles and Goals

The design rests on a small spine of foundational principles; the capability and
pragmatic principles below are consequences of it, and the goals that follow each
realize one or more of them.
Every later decision should cite the principle it serves.

### Principles

**Tier 1 — Foundational (the spine):**

- **P1. One immutable source, one shared offset space, is the canonical substrate.**
  Every structure aligns to `source_text` by exact `[start, end)` in Unicode code
  points. This, not any one parsed structure, is what unifies the model.
- **P2. Source is canonical; every structural model is a derived, re-derivable
  projection.** Edits go through the source/editing view and re-derive; the parsed model
  is read-mostly and never drifts from the text (DR-1/DR-2).
- **P3. Layered parsing; cross-layer relationships are offset-containment queries, not
  stored edges.** The same source is parsed along independent dimensions (textual,
  markdown, document, synthetic), each tagged by `layer`; relations *between* layers are
  interval containment, never persisted edges.
- **P4. Mechanism over menu.** One general query primitive (`collect()`) and two
  composable serialization axes (`include` layers / `detail` payloads); no blessed
  per-kind rollups or fixed detail ladders.
  New capability is one additive layer or detail, not an API refactor (DR-4/DR-5).
- **P5. Model ≠ format ≠ implementation.** The contract is a language-neutral JSON
  schema (Pydantic-authored, DR-3); Python today, Rust/TypeScript later, implement one
  frozen contract.

**Tier 2 — Representation (what the model must faithfully carry):**

- **P6. Exact ground-truth references** (`source_text[s:e] == original_text`).
- **P7. Faithful, complete Markdown structure** — all modern block and inline kinds
  (tables, footnotes, fenced code, blockquotes, inline/block HTML, images); one
  top-level type per block; recursive, fully-populated nesting; bullet vs.
  ordered distinct.
- **P8. Textual structure with clean round-trip** — paragraphs/sentences/wordtoks as the
  editing view; edit units and `reassemble()`.
- **P9. Document structure** — heading hierarchy, sections, and TOC, with section
  containment ("which paragraphs are in which section").
- **P10. Synthetic tag structure** — a small marker-tag whitelist (today
  `<div>`/`<span>`) as a first-class layer, not a special case.
- **P11. Clean whole-tree round-trip editing** — after arbitrary edits, reproduce a
  document with Markdown-object-level equivalence, and byte-exact equivalence when
  Flowmark-normalized or reconstructed from retained offsets (two distinct equivalence
  levels).

**Tier 3 — Pragmatics (cost, ergonomics, robustness):**

- **P12. Single canonical form, derived views, no stored counts** — sections, slices,
  and tallies are calculated fields; if a view is hard to derive, refine the form.
- **P13. Complete base-block partition** — a flat, ordered, non-overlapping,
  depth-annotated cover of the whole document that reassembles to the source.
- **P14. Serializable projections** — full parse or any slice to language-neutral JSON
  for frontends.
- **P15. Parse cost ≈ one Markdown parse; expensive views are lazy** — pay for costly
  rollups on demand, cached on the immutable source.
- **P16. Approximation where cheap and sufficient** — fast regex sentence segmentation
  and heuristic token sizing are accepted; exactness is reserved for offsets/spans.
- **P17. Graceful tolerance of malformed input** — never throw on bad Markdown; degrade
  to best-effort structure.
- **P18. Additive evolution** — existing diff/window/wordtok behavior preserved; new
  layers and details are additive.

### Goals

Each goal realizes the principle(s) noted.

- **One consolidating structure** (P7, P8, P9). Markdown block, inline, language, and
  document structure in one object, not four tools stitched together.
- **Exact source anchoring** (P1, P6). Every unit references the source by
  `[start, end)`; spans round-trip verbatim; no copies, no drift.
  Offsets are **Unicode code points**.
- **Normalized form, derived views** (P12). One canonical form anchored to the offset
  space; section hierarchy, block-type slices, element rollups, and tallies are
  *calculated fields*, never stored.
  If a view is hard to derive, refine the form.
- **Simplicity with flexibility (mechanism over menu)** (P4). One general query
  primitive (`collect()`), composable serialization layers (`include`), not a fixed menu
  of blessed rollups or detail levels, so the model serves many downstream uses without
  per-need API changes (DR-4, DR-5).
- **Markdown-correspondent block types** (P7). One-to-one with Markdown kinds (bullet
  vs. ordered lists distinct); each block has one top-level type; nesting is recursive
  and fully populated.
- **Two block views** (P13). A recursive **structural block tree** (for
  nesting/slicing/queries) and a flat **sequential base-block list** (a complete,
  ordered, non-overlapping partition whose reassembly reproduces the document), so a
  pipeline can process or resequence a document block by block.
- **Density-invariant lists** (P7, P12). Tight and loose lists produce identical
  tallies.
- **Source-canonical references** (P1, P2). A span reference is durable for annotations
  across edits (`SpanRef`, DR-6): a text quote is the canonical anchor, offsets are
  recomputable hints.
- **Cross-language contract** (P5, P14). `DocGraph` is a boring, parser-agnostic JSON
  schema (Pydantic-authored, DR-3); Python and any future TypeScript/Rust client are
  implementations of one contract.
- **Dual use** (P8, P11). Analysis of a fixed document *and* an editable model: modify
  units, reassemble, serialize a clean normalized document.
- **LLM/agent-friendly, Python-first, Rust-portable** (P5). Ergonomic from Python and
  from LLM/agent code; a tight spec and thorough tests make a Rust port feasible.
- **Minimal dependencies; additive** (P18). Existing diff/window/wordtok behavior
  preserved.

## 3. The Normalized Form

Everything is aligned by span into a single retained `source_text`. The **canonical
substrate is the source text plus its offset space** (P1): every structure references
the source by exact `[start, end)` (Unicode code points) and is a derived projection.
The **node table** is the primary such projection — a stable set of nodes addressable by
id and span — and is what the serialized contract and cross-layer queries are built on
(DR-1):

1. **Source:** `source_text` plus exact `[start, end)` spans (Unicode code points); each
   unit’s `original_text` is a computed slice, exact by construction.
2. **Node table:** one node per block, inline element, and heading:
   `Node{id, kind, parent, children, source_span, attrs}`. Block containment is
   `parent`/`children`; this is taken from marko’s parse and *referenced*, not
   duplicated.
3. **Language structure:** paragraphs, sentences, and the wordtok view, with spans and
   spacing tokens (the editing view).

A leading YAML frontmatter block (`---`-delimited) is a **non-content region**: it is
excluded from the node table, the block/section views, and the editing view (and so from
every size/prose count), and exposed verbatim via `TextDoc.frontmatter`. `source_text`
retains it, so spans stay absolute and the document still round-trips.

Why a node table and not a single tree: a document has several hierarchies that overlap
and do not nest: a **section** spans sibling blocks and is not a subtree of the block
tree; **links** are inline ranges; **annotations** target arbitrary spans.
A single canonical tree privileges one hierarchy and forces the rest into bespoke
overlays. A node table gives one id space for blocks *and* inline items, so the
containment tree, section tree, block list, link index, and token stream all share one
id space, and the serialized JSON still presents a `document` root with children as its
top-level shape.

The ergonomic Python views (`blocks()`, `sections()`, `links()`, `base_blocks()`) and
the node table both derive from the same memoized structural parse over the shared
offset space; they are sibling projections, not a store and lookups into it.
This keeps parse cost at roughly one Markdown parse (P15) without coupling every view to
the node-table schema.

**Views over the form.** Several ways to walk the same `source_text`, none of them the
canonical store:

- the blank-line `Paragraph`/`Sentence` **editing view** (used by diff/window/wordtok);
- the **structural block tree** (the recursive Markdown backbone: slicing, nesting,
  per-item access);
- the **sequential block list** (the flat, non-recursive *base-block* partition, §6);
- the **section tree** (heading hierarchy);
- the **inline/link index**.

The editing view’s block boundaries are unchanged by the structural tree, so there is no
forced migration of the editing unit.

**Parse layers.** Those views are not ad-hoc; each is one **parse layer** over the
shared offset space.
chopdiff parses the same `source_text` along several independent dimensions, each
contributing nodes tagged with their `layer`:

| Layer | Produces | Depends on | Nesting guarantee |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **textual** | paragraphs, sentences, word tokens | — | ordered list |
| **markdown** | block elements (recursive) and inline (links, code, emphasis) | — | tree |
| **document** | section / heading hierarchy and TOC | markdown (headings) | tree |
| **synthetic** | regions marked by a small defined set of marker tags (today `<div>`/`<span>`), chunk groupings (later phase) | — | tree |

Two consequences define how layers interact:

- **Cross-layer relationships are offset-containment queries, not stored edges.** Within
  a layer, navigate `parent`/`children`; *across* layers, use interval
  containment/overlap ("which markdown blocks are inside this `<div>`", “which section
  contains this link”). This is what lets layers overlap and cross-cut without
  contradiction (a section is not a subtree of the block tree; a `<div>` may open
  mid-block).
- **Each layer declares a nesting guarantee:** well-nested layers project to a tree
  view, ordered-only layers to a sequential list view (the §6 tree-vs-partition
  distinction, generalized).
  The `SpanRef`-targeted annotation layer (§11) is the out-of-band layer, anchored to
  the same offset space.

The **synthetic layer is a general mechanism, not a `<div>` special case:** synthetic
structure is introduced by a small, defined vocabulary of marker tags that delimit
regions for chunking, grouping, and in-band metadata.
The vocabulary is a fixed, known whitelist and can take any of these forms:

- standard HTML containers, today `<div>`/`<span>` via `TextNode`;
- custom semantic XML tags such as `<chunk>`;
- comment-delimited (Markdoc-style) directives such as `<!-- chunk id="foo" -->`, which
  carry structure in Markdown without rendering.

The layer carries each region as a node with its tag name and attributes in `attrs`, so
a new marker tag is configuration (an entry in the whitelist), not a new code path.

Layers are **enabled à la carte** (a configuration, not a fork): today’s `TextNode` tag
subsystem is “the synthetic layer alone,” and the full analysis path enables several.

for the framing and prior art.

## 4. Core Types, Nodes, and Offsets

- `TextDoc`: retains `source_text`; owns the `Paragraph` list (editing view) and the
  derived, lazily-cached node table and views.
- `Node`: `id` (stable within a parse), `kind` (a `BlockType` or an inline kind),
  `layer` (the parse dimension it belongs to, textual / markdown / document / synthetic;
  §3), `parent`, `children`, `source_span`, `attrs` (e.g. heading level,
  `List.ordered`/`tight`, link url/title).
  `parent`/`children` are within-layer edges; cross-layer relationships are
  offset-containment queries (§3). Parser-internal details live in `attrs`/`metadata`,
  never in stable public fields.
- `Paragraph`: a blank-line block: `sentences`, `Offsets`, `span`, cached top-level
  `block_type`, computed `original_text`, helpers (`heading_level()`, `heading_title()`,
  `links()`).
- `Sentence`: `text` (normalized, editable; what wordtoks/diffs/reassemble use),
  `Offsets`, `span`, verbatim `original_text` computed from the span.
- `Offsets(doc_offset, block_offset)`: `doc_offset` absolute; `block_offset` relative to
  the parent. **Offset unit is Unicode code points** (Python-native); `DocGraph` may
  expose derived `byte_span`/`utf16_span` for byte- or browser-oriented consumers, but
  the canonical `source_span` is code points (the cross-language footgun the W3C
  position selector left unresolved).
- `TextDoc.block_at_offset(o)` / `sentence_at_offset(o)` invert spans.

Invariant: `source_text[unit.span[0]:unit.span[1]] == unit.original_text` for every
source-backed unit. Synthetic docs (`from_wordtoks`, `append_sent`) have no source, so
`source_text` is the reassembled working text.

Sentence spans are exact for all content via flowmark’s `split_sentences_with_spans`:
`SentenceSpan`s are verbatim and never bisect a link, code span, autolink, or URL.
`Sentence.text` stays whitespace-normalized; `original_text`/spans are verbatim.

## 5. Block-Type Model

`BlockType` corresponds one-to-one to Markdown block kinds: `heading`, `paragraph`,
`list` (bullet/unordered), `ordered_list`, `list_item`, `table`, `code`, `blockquote`,
`html`, `footnote`, `thematic_break`.

- **Bullet vs. ordered lists are distinct types.** marko’s `List` carries `ordered`;
  `list` is the bullet list, `ordered_list` is enumerated, `list_item` is shared.
- **One top-level type per block,** from its **outer** element: a blockquote wrapping a
  table classifies as `blockquote` at the top level.
  This is what the top-level views and default rollups key on.
- **Nesting is recursive and fully populated.** Every container (blockquote, list item)
  has its block children in the node table, so a table nested inside a blockquote *is* a
  node and is found by a recursive `collect()`. The inner table keeps its own `table`
  kind; default (shallow) rollups attribute it to its enclosing top-level block,
  recursive rollups count it directly.

**List density must not change tallies.** A dense list and the same list written
sparsely are the same list.
In the structural tree a list **always decomposes into `list_item` children regardless
of density**: a loose list is *one* list block with blank-line-separated items, not N
lists, so `len(list.children)` and any tally are density-invariant.
Density is metadata, not structure: a `tight: bool` on the list (CommonMark semantics);
the flag never enters a tally.

**Typed per-block metadata.** Code, table, and list blocks carry parser-authoritative
typed metadata (`flexdoc.docs.block_info`): `CodeInfo` (`language`, `line_count`),
`TableInfo` (`rows`, `cols`, `cells`, `alignments`), and `ListInfo` (`ordered`, `start`,
`max_depth`, `item_count`). It is computed once where the marko element is in hand and
exposed on the structural `Block` (`Block.code_info`/`.table_info`/`.list_info` — the
density-invariant source of truth) and, as a convenience carrying the editing-view density
caveat, on `Paragraph`. The same facts are flattened into the markdown node's `attrs`, so
they flow into `collect()`/`DocGraph`. Extraction is parser-authoritative (marko element
attributes, never a regex over source); a table column with no alignment marker is
`"default"`, not `None`, so `alignments` is always explicit strings of length `cols`.

## 6. Block Views: Structural Tree and Sequential Base-Block List

**Terminology.** To avoid overloading “block”:

- **block element** / **inline element:** the Markdown element *class* (CommonMark/mdast
  sense): block-level (heading, paragraph, blockquote, list, list item, table, code, …)
  vs inline (link, code span, emphasis, …).
- **block node:** a node with a block kind in the recursive **structural block tree**
  (`blocks()`); containers (blockquote, list, list item) contain child block nodes.
- **base block:** a unit of the flat **sequential block list** (`base_blocks()`): a
  complete, ordered, non-overlapping partition of the document into the units a pipeline
  processes or a UI resequences.

These are two views over the same shared parse, for two different jobs (and they must
not be conflated; see §9: the tree supports *queries* that may overlap; the base-block
list is a *partition* with a cover invariant).

### Structural block tree: `TextDoc.blocks() -> list[Block]`

The recursive view (lazy, cached on the immutable `source_text`):

- `Block(type, span, children, tight)`: `span` is trimmed so `source[start:end]` is the
  exact text; `children` holds nested blocks.
  A `list`/`ordered_list` block’s children are its `list_item`s; **containers fully
  populate their block children** (a blockquote’s or list item’s nested blocks are
  present). `tight` carries CommonMark list density on list blocks (`None` elsewhere).
- Resolves what blank-line splitting cannot: a fenced code block stays whole even with
  internal blank lines; a list decomposes into items with nested sublists; a table
  inside a blockquote is reachable.

Block boundaries and spans come straight from flowmark’s parser: every block element
carries an authoritative `element.span = (start, end)` read from marko’s own source
positions (`flowmark.markdown_ast.block_span`), so chopdiff runs no block-detection
regex of its own and makes no block-boundary decisions.
The structure is cross-checked against marko in tests.

### Sequential block list: `TextDoc.base_blocks() -> list[BaseBlock]`

A **base block** is a `BaseBlock` wrapping a block node (`Block`) with a `depth`; the
**base-block list** is a *partition* of the document: the ordered sequence of base
blocks, each carrying its `depth`. `TextDoc.base_blocks()` is a thin method over the
`flexdoc.docs.base_blocks.base_blocks(text, *, item_partition_depth=6)` free function
(the partition lives in its own module, distinct from the recursive tree in
`block_tree.py`). It is the view for block-by-block pipelines and outline UIs that
move/resequence blocks (e.g. Notion-style drag-and-drop, where every item is a draggable
unit). chopdiff does not implement such UIs, but the model supports addressing and
reordering at this granularity.
Document manipulation and processing happen base block by base block.

**Frontier.** Leaf and atomic blocks (heading, paragraph, table, code, thematic break,
HTML, and a whole **blockquote**) are each one base block.
**Lists decompose:** each **list item, at every nesting level, is its own base block**
with increasing `depth` (flat-with-depth).
An item holding a nested list contributes a `list_item` **head** block (the marker and
lead content) at depth *d*, then its nested items at *d+1*; any **continuation** content
(paragraphs after or between sublists) follows as base blocks carrying their **own real
block type** (e.g. `paragraph`) at depth *d* — never relabeled `list_item`, so a
consumer can tell a continuation paragraph apart from an independent list item.

How deep lists decompose is one numeric parameter,
`base_blocks(item_partition_depth=6)`:

- `item_partition_depth = N` (default **6**, deep enough for normal nested lists): split
  list items down to *N* nesting levels; list content nested deeper than *N* stays whole
  inside its depth-*N* base block (avoids pathological fan-out on very deep lists).
- `item_partition_depth = -1`: unlimited; split at every nesting level.
- `item_partition_depth = 0`: lists are not split; each list is a single base block
  (coarse mode, i.e. the top-level blocks).

Blockquotes are always one base block regardless of `item_partition_depth`.

**Invariants** (validated and documented): the base-block list is **ordered** by
position, **non-overlapping** by span, and together the spans **cover every
non-whitespace character exactly once** (the gaps are inter-block and structural
whitespace). Every base block retains its exact `source_span`, so **exact source
reconstruction is by slicing the source at those spans** (or via the structural
`blocks()` tree). Reassembling the rendered base-block *text* is **lossy for list-item
continuation content** — list markers and continuation indentation are whitespace
outside the trimmed spans, so naive text concatenation normalizes them; reconstruct from
offsets when exactness matters.
A pipeline may process, edit, or **resequence** base blocks; `depth` is mutable
metadata, so promoting a depth-2 item to depth-1 on a move just changes its rendered
nesting, not a violation.

## 7. Sections and TOC

A derived hierarchy over heading nodes, no re-parse:

- `Section`: heading, `level`, the content it owns (up to the next heading of level ≤
  this), child `Section`s. Content/span/sizes are computed; `Section.blocks()` is the
  block tree scoped to the section.
- `TextDoc.sections()` → tree; `toc()` → flat `(level, title, span)`.
- Sizes reuse `TextDoc.size`: `Section.size(unit, subtree=True|False)`,
  `size_summary()`, `TextDoc.section_size_tree(units=…)`. Every `TextUnit` rolls up
  uniformly.

## 8. Inline Elements and Links

Inline elements (links, code spans, images, inline HTML, footnote references, …) are
**first-class nodes** whose `parent` is their containing block, with computed
`section`/`sentence` associations, so block↔inline relationships are node edges, and
“links in section 3” is a scoped `collect(kinds={link})`.

- `Link(text, url, title, span)`: identity from `flowmark.markdown_ast.extract_links`
  (reference links resolved, escapes honored, autolinks/images handled), which carries
  no span by design. chopdiff recovers each exact `[start, end)` by reconciling the
  ordered identities with the name-tagged atomic spans from
  `flowmark.atomic_spans.iter_atomic_spans` (`markdown_link` / `autolink` / `bare_url`);
  reference links keep identity but no exact span.
- `link → sentence` via `sentence_at_offset(link.span[0])`.
- **`footnote_ref`**: a footnote reference `[^label]` is a first-class inline node
  (`NodeKind.footnote_ref`) carrying its `label` in `attrs` and an exact span, collected
  like any inline kind (`collect(kinds={NodeKind.footnote_ref}, recursive=True)`). A
  footnote *definition* (`[^label]:`) is a `footnote` block, not a reference.

## 9. Derived Views and Rollups

All derived from the canonical source/offset substrate (the node table is the
id-addressed projection used for queries); nothing stores counts. These structural/query
views describe the parsed `source_text`; after editing, re-parse with
`from_text(doc.reassemble())` before structural analysis.
The surface is **one general query primitive, no blessed per-kind rollups** (DR-4):

```python
collect(*, subtree_of=None, within=None, overlaps=None,
        kinds=None, where=None, recursive=False, inline=False, layer=None) -> list[Node]
```

Available as `doc.collect(...)` (and as the free `collect(table, ...)` over a node
table). Two distinct relations select candidates. The **tree** relation `subtree_of=`
takes a node id and restricts to that node's within-layer parent/child subtree
(`recursive` descends it). The **interval** relations are cross-layer and offset-based,
each accepting a node id or `(start, end)` span: `within=` keeps nodes whose span is
contained in the region (e.g. `within=section_id` for everything inside a section);
`overlaps=` keeps nodes whose span merely intersects the region. Supplying an interval
relation scans the whole document, so `within=section_id` needs no `recursive=True`.
`kinds=` selects by node kind (the typed common case); `where=` is a `Node -> bool`
predicate escape hatch; `inline` includes inline nodes (an explicit inline `kinds` such
as `{NodeKind.link}` implies this); `layer=` restricts to parse layers. It returns
**nodes** (each with `span`, `attrs`, edges). (`scope=` and `contains=` remain as
deprecated aliases for `subtree_of=` and `within=`.) **Counts, values, and groupings are
standard Python** over the result, documented with worked examples, not separate methods:

```python
doc.collect(kinds={NodeKind.table}, recursive=True)        # the tables (values + spans)
len(doc.collect(kinds={NodeKind.table}, recursive=True))   # how many
Counter(n.kind for n in doc.collect(recursive=True))       # tally by kind
doc.collect(within=section_id, kinds={NodeKind.link})      # links in a section
```

Slice-by-block-type, per-section rollups, and element rollups are all expressions of
this one primitive; relationships are node edges.
There are no `tables()`/`code_blocks()` shortcuts to maintain.

**Query vs. partition; do not conflate.** `collect()` is a *query*: it gathers matching
nodes and the results may **overlap** their containers (a table nested in a blockquote
is returned by `collect(kinds={table}, recursive=True)` alongside the blockquote).
That is correct for counting/gathering.
The base-block list (§6) is a *partition*: a complete, ordered, **non-overlapping**
cover for linear processing.
Use `collect()` to ask “how many / which”; use `base_blocks()` to iterate the document’s
content units.

## 10. DocGraph: The Serialized Projection

`DocGraph` is the JSON contract derived from `TextDoc` (DR-1, DR-2), authored as
Pydantic models that emit a JSON Schema (DR-3). Boring and parser-agnostic: no
marko/Python class names in stable fields.
Shape (abbreviated):

```
DocGraph = {
  schema: "DocGraph/v0.1",
  source:  { format, offset_unit: "unicode_code_points", sha256, text? },
  nodes:   [ Node, ... ],                       # the canonical node table
  views:   { toc, blocks, links, sentences },   # arrays of node ids (projections)
  annotations: [],  layout: [],  provenance: [] # reserved layers (later phases)
}
```

`TextDoc.graph(*, include=..., detail=...)` builds/serializes it.
**What is built and serialized is controlled by two composable axes**, not a fixed
ladder (DR-5):

```python
graph()                                                  # default layers, structural core
graph(include={Layer.markdown, Layer.document})          # blocks + sections
graph(include={Layer.markdown}, detail={Detail.text, Detail.inline})  # + node text + inline
```

- **`include` is a set of `Layer`s:** the parse dimensions of §3: `textual`, `markdown`,
  `document`, `synthetic`, later `annotations`/`layout`. Enabling a layer builds and
  serializes its nodes/views; enabling `document` auto-enables its dependency
  `markdown`.
- **`detail` is a small set of payload sub-options:** `text` (per-node source text),
  `inline` (inline nodes), `tokens`, derived coords, controlling richness *within*
  enabled layers.

The structural core (node table, `layer`, and spans) is always present.
Presets are caller-defined `frozenset`s, documented as examples.
A new parse dimension is one additive `Layer`; a new payload category is one additive
`Detail`, never a refactor.
(One vocabulary: the earlier mixed `Layer` enum was split into `Layer` and `Detail` per
E9; see the plan’s DR-5.)

## 11. SpanRef and Annotations

`SpanRef` is the one span-reference type used for addressing a piece of the document
from source, parsed model, and rendered output (DR-6). It carries two coordinated span
kinds:

```
SpanRef = {
  exact: str, prefix?: str, suffix?: str,   # quoted span — CANONICAL durable anchor
  start?: int, end?: int,                   # offset span (code points) — recomputable HINT
}
```

- **Quote canonical, offset a hint.** Every mature annotation system (W3C `oa:Choice`,
  Hypothesis) treats the text quote as the durable anchor and offsets as accelerators,
  because the quote survives edits and re-anchors while offsets shift.
  Within one parse the offset is exact (the fast path); across edits the quote recovers
  the target.
- **Resolution.** model→source is total (a node fills both span and quote). source→model
  is an exact offset fast path, then an exact quote search disambiguated by
  prefix/suffix; `resolve()` is pure (it does not mutate the ref), and
  `resolve_and_update()` is the explicit variant that writes the recomputed offsets back.
  Fuzzy/edit-distance re-anchoring is deferred (not yet implemented).
- **Persistence** is quote-canonical and source-grounded; offsets are an optional
  position hint (`to_persisted(include_position_hint=...)`, dropped by default) and an
  in-memory `node_id` handle is never persisted.
- **Chrome URL Text Fragment convertible:** the quote maps to
  `#:~:text=[prefix-,]exact[,-suffix]` (a lossy projection: prose, word-boundary,
  case-insensitive), generated on demand, never stored.
- **Deferred:** an XPath/DOM `structural_path` and a CRDT `anchor` slot, added only on a
  concrete need.

Annotations are a **stand-off layer**: parsed structure (sections, blocks, links) and
added structure (summaries, notes, suggestions) are the same kind of thing: typed layers
of `SpanRef`-targeted records over immutable source.
**The annotation layer is a later phase** and is expected to be revisited and refined
once v1 is in use; v1 fixes the `SpanRef` contract (at least as expressive as the
Chrome-style `exact`+`prefix`/`suffix` floor) so the node model, schema, and editor
bridge are designed around it.

Background, syntaxes, and the syntactic-vs-quoted trade-offs are surveyed (with
citations) in
[`research-2026-05-30-span-references.md`](project/research/research-2026-05-30-span-references.md).

## 12. Editing and Serialization

`Sentence.text` is the editable content: edits change what `reassemble()` produces while
the fixed source references (`original_text`, `offsets`, cached `block_type`) keep
describing the original.
So `TextDoc` doubles as an editable model: modify units, then `reassemble()` to
serialize a new document (optionally normalized by flowmark).
The diff/sliding-window/wordtok machinery operates on this editing view unchanged.

The structural node table is a pure function of the immutable `source_text` (sentence
edits touch the editing view, not `source_text`), so it and its derived views are lazily
cached; the operative contract is “do not reassign `source_text` after parse.”
Edit by editing the `TextDoc`/source and re-deriving `DocGraph`; an editor bridge
resolves annotations through `SpanRef`. Render helpers emit `data-node-id` /
`data-source-span` so a rendered selection resolves to a node and thence to source.

## 13. Invariants and Non-Goals

Invariants: offset-anchored (code points), the source + offset space being the canonical
substrate (P1); node ids stable within a parse; derived views over one shared parse (no
duplicated content, no stored counts), the node table among them; references are
quote-canonical; additive (existing behavior preserved).

Non-goals: a parallel runtime `BlockDoc`/`SectionDoc`/`FlexDoc` Python model (DocGraph
is a projection, not a competing editable model); blessed per-kind rollups or fixed
detail levels; DOM/XPath/CSS selectors in `SpanRef` (plain-text-first); CommonMark/GFM
rendering (flowmark covers normalization); stored cross-layer edges (cross-layer
relationships are offset-containment queries, §3); exact provider-keyed token counts
(`estimate_tokens` is a heuristic); a thread-safety layer.

**Later phases, not non-goals (E9).** The **synthetic layer**, re-expressing today’s
`TextNode` tag chunking (a small defined set of marker tags, today `<div>`/`<span>`) as
a layer keyed into the node table, and **cross-layer structural edits**
(move/wrap/splice anchored on `SpanRef`, generalizing `div_insert_wrapped`) are deferred
phases, not excluded.
`TextNode` stays as-is meanwhile.
The annotation, operation, provenance, and layout layers are likewise schema-reserved
and built later. The Phase-1 hooks (the `layer` field, offset-containment `collect()`,
`SpanRef`-anchored edits) keep these a small lift rather than a redesign.

### Pitfalls and Key Decisions

Non-obvious choices, each grounded in a principle:

- **The shared offset space — not the node table — is the canonical substrate** (P1).
  The node table is one projection (the id-addressed, layer-tagged,
  serialization-friendly one); it is built *from* the parses, and
  `blocks()`/`sections()`/`links()` derive from the same memoized parse rather than from
  the table’s id space.
  “Single canonical form” holds at the parse + offset space.
- **Cross-layer overlap is expected** (P3). The same logical paragraph appears as
  distinct nodes in distinct layers (a `markdown` block node and a `textual` paragraph
  node over the same span), so a query that does not restrict `layer` returns both.
  This is honest, not a bug; scope with `collect(layer=…)`.
- **Tight vs. loose lists are structurally identical** (P7, P12). Density is
  `Block.tight` metadata only and never enters a tally.
- **Base blocks decompose lists recursively** to `item_partition_depth` (default 6);
  blockquotes are always atomic (P13).
- **Fast/approximate sentence segmentation is accepted** (P16): the regex splitter
  avoids a Spacy dependency; offsets stay exact via the span-aware splitter.
- **Fast/approximate token sizing is accepted** (P16): `estimate_tokens` is a heuristic,
  not provider-keyed.
- **Reference links and other unlocatable identities carry `span=None`** and are
  excluded from offset-scoped rollups (e.g. `Section.links()`), since they cannot be
  attributed by offset.
- **Offsets are Unicode code points** (P1); byte/UTF-16 are derived on demand, never
  canonical.
- **Round-trip is Markdown-object-exact, not byte-exact** (P11), except byte-exact via
  retained offsets or after Flowmark normalization — two distinct equivalence levels.

## 14. Implementation Status

- **Implemented (block-aware layer):** exact spans; the opt-in structural block tree
  `blocks()` (boundaries and spans from flowmark, no regex scanner); sections/TOC/size
  rollups; inline-link rollups and link-aware sentences; `ordered_list`/density-invariant
  lists; per-section blocks; and typed per-block metadata
  (`CodeInfo`/`TableInfo`/`ListInfo`, §5).
- **Implemented (DocGraph layer):** the recursive node table (containers fully populate
  children, including blockquote and list-item block children); the `base_blocks()`
  sequential partition with its non-overlapping cover invariant; the single `collect()`
  query primitive; composable `include` layers and `detail` payload options; inline kinds
  including `footnote_ref` (§8); the `DocGraph` Pydantic schema ("DocGraph/v0.1"); and the
  `SpanRef` contract with exact + prefix/suffix quote resolution (fuzzy re-anchoring
  deferred).
- **In progress:** annotation layer, synthetic layer (re-expressing `TextNode` tag
  chunking as a layer), cross-layer structural edits, and operation/provenance/layout
  layers. Tracked by epic `chopdiff-8q8q`; sequenced in
  [`plan-2026-05-29-unified-document-model.md`](project/specs/active/plan-2026-05-29-unified-document-model.md).
